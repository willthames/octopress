  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s nice to be prepared for a run for once. I&#8217;ve been concentrating on my running fairly solidly for the last few weeks, even going so far as to work on my technique. I accidentally managed a 25km run three weeks ago, after I chose a route without thinking about just how far it would be. My tapering in the last week has been reasonable, with a 13km run last weekend and an 8.5km run mid-week.</p>

<p>I got up in good time, had breakfast and got to the tube at the planned time. Apparently you can get to Uxbridge in 40mins from Hammersmith on a Sunday morning, but not on the trains I got - I had to change twice. I arrived in Uxbridge half an hour before the race, and so did the 2km to the race start as a run/walk. On arrival at the site, I took off my jacket, pinned my number on and then put my bag into the van taking bags from start to finish, and was ready to go.</p>

<p>After a short wait to allow everyone to get their bags onto the truck, there was a minute&#8217;s silence and we were off. A quick lap of Cowley Recreation Ground preceded the run along the towpath (I guess in the hope that it would thin out the crowd a little). I started off quite deep in crowd, and there was a lot of movement for position, and a few stops as we all milled through the bottlenecks, but I was quite happy with a gentle start off, my first km was around 5:45.</p>

<p>I found the traffic reasonable after the first kilometre, I was still passing and being passed, and my pace soon settled into a steady rhythm. I chose people who seemed to be going at a reasonable and steady pace, and followed them until I was feeling strong and passed them, moving through the field slowly but surely.</p>

<p>I greatly enjoyed the scenery, I love running by water, and the many bridges and locks along the way broke it up sufficiently. As we were running up-river, all of the locks were uphill, so I used those as attacking points to pass other runners.</p>

<p>I was very pleased that I was overtaken by just one person in the second half of the race, and not because my pace deteriorated, so I&#8217;m not sure where he came from - a late starter, or a loo break? My pace seemed to improve towards the end of the race - indeed my final three kms were the fastest of the day!</p>

<p>The last kilometre was a killer - a small hill going into Cassiobury Park, certainly took a lot of effort to maintain a decent pace, but I managed to pass a couple of people walking going up the hill, and two more at the top. As I rounded the final corner about 300m from the finish, the person I was just about to pass noticed me and picked up his pace - we didn&#8217;t quite have a sprint finish but it was much faster than the rest of the race! I couldn&#8217;t quite take him in the end. I noticed Peta as I was coming into the final straight, but I was in the shadow of the other runner and so she saw me quite late, but it was great to see her there in support.</p>

<p>I picked up my medal, had some water, had a hug and then we waited for the bags to turn up - I&#8217;d beaten the luggage, go me! Luckily didn&#8217;t have to wait too long before we could get my bag and catch the train home again.</p>

<p>This was probably my favourite running race yet (difficult to compare it against a triathlon), perhaps mostly due to the autumnal weather - I only used one water stop in the end as I just didn&#8217;t need more. It was very picturesque, an interesting course (my off-road shoes probably helped - it wasn&#8217;t tricky terrain, just muddy and a bit slippery in places) with bridges, locks etc, and in conditions that suited me very well.</p>
