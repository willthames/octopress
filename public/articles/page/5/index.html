  <div class="entry-content"><p>First, a note on official distances - the run was indeed short (9.4km) as indeed was the bike (38km). To do that extra 2.6km would have taken me around 7 mins (5min/km on the run, 2min/km on the bike), so I should have still completed the proper olympic distance in my goal time of under 3 hours. I still feel a little short-changed, there must have been something they could have done to lengthen the run!</p>

<p>Right, onto the analysis. The results page allows you to download excel spreadsheets of the results for each age group (not just my wave) so I&#8217;m able to compare against people who are most similar to me (males aged 30-35). This means that I can find out which events I was weakest at compared to my peers.</p>

<p>I had to eliminate a few people who did better than me, simply because they only had a final total, and not times for the individual events, so I can&#8217;t do any analysis on that - after all, I know where I came relative to everyone overall, and that was 396th out of 490 in my age group. Also, I left out the non-finishers from the analysis.</p>

<p>A couple of technical notes on the analysis - I used Excel&#8217;s Rank function to determine my rank (using descending order, as lower numbers are better when it comes to time). However, Rank doesn&#8217;t work on the values in the spreadsheet from London Triathlon, so I had to add a column next to each time that I was interested in, and convert the time using the Value function. I could then use Rank on that column.</p>

<p>Results: Swim: 371 out of 475, Bike: 403 out of 475, Run: 351 out of 475</p>

<p>And as triathlon is actually a four-discipline sport, we shouldn&#8217;t forget transitions. I lost 20 places in T1! I only lost 6 further places on the bike. I made up 2 places in T2, and then made up three places on the run.</p>

<p>Clearly the big lesson, however, is that relative to others, my bike is very weak, weaker even than my swim! Given the bike is the longest part of the race, it&#8217;s here that the most benefits are to be had.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Competitive-Runners-Handbook-Robert-Glover/dp/0140469907/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1249927537&sr=8-1">Competitive Runners&#8217; Handbook</a> defines the status of a competitor based on how fast you are relative to the best. The closest comparison I can make easily is to the splits of the Male Elite winner, Will Clarke. My speed compared to his speed will give a ratio, and 50% is often beginner or novice, 60% is basic competitor, etc.</p>

<p>Because I&#8217;m comparing to an athlete on a day, rather than the record, the numbers here might be higher than they should be, but they&#8217;re still interesting</p>

<p>Swim: 53%, Bike 68%, Run: 59%</p>

<p>So by this measure I&#8217;m closer to my maximum bike speed than I am to either running or swimming. Oh, and Will Clarke was four times quicker in T1, although I suspect he wasn&#8217;t wearing a wetsuit. Brrr.</p>

<p>The evidence is therefore a little conflicting. Our best age group bike split was 56 mins, which suggests I can only improve by at most 25 mins on the bike - I was hoping I was so slow that getting my time down to an hour would be just a matter of putting in the miles, but clearly not. Still, if I can shave 10 mins off the bike, 10 mins off the swim and 5 mins off the run then I can go sub 2:30 at London (I&#8217;d need to shave more if the course lengths were changed!)</p>

<p>What have I learnt from this? Not as much as I&#8217;d hoped. I&#8217;m more interested in improving my overall time than in beating other people, and I&#8217;d like to apply appropriate focus to squeezing the best I can out of training, but I think the lessons to be learned are more miles on the bike and start working on swim speed in addition to stamina. I knew that already though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have three classes of tricky training weeks (weeks where it&#8217;s tricky to get training in, rather than weeks where the training is tricky)<ul><li>Holiday</li><li>On-call</li><li>Staff Training</li></ul>
It&#8217;s easiest to decide to have a rest week when holiday gets in the way - I&#8217;m not an elite athlete, and resting for a week won&#8217;t damage my progress too much. Sure, if I can get a swim or a run in, then I will, but I won&#8217;t beat myself up about missing training.</p>

<p>For on-call, it can be tricky as I can&#8217;t really go more than 15 mins from home, so run or bike laps would have to be quite close to home. During the week I can work at the office or from home when on-call - I find it easier to think at home, and easier if there are meetings to be in the office. When scheduling allows, therefore, running at lunchtime can be done from home, swimming at lunchtime can be done from work, and cycling will have to end up on the turbo at home. I can optionally go to the gym for strength work or to use treadmill or exercise bike, but typically I&#8217;ll get more benefit from the turbo at home.</p>

<p>There seem to be a few longer spinerval DVDs (including one three-DVD set that covers a 5 hour session!), which I might have to invest in for when I&#8217;m doing much longer bike sessions. At the moment 45 mins does me in!</p>

<p>When I&#8217;m training people, it&#8217;s typically at Wembley or Fulham football stadiums. While you might think that they&#8217;d be easy places to get exercise in, they don&#8217;t seem to like you running on the football pitches, and I&#8217;ve not found showers that aren&#8217;t for players only (although I should ask if there are showers people can use). I could cycle to them to get some exercise in, and I could run at lunch, but that&#8217;s no use without showers. At least at Fulham it&#8217;s easy to run home or go for a swim on the way home. As I do longer mid-week runs, running home from Wembley might seem a reasonable choice!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I will start at the end - the drive home was an absolute nightmare, 4h30 from Docklands to Hammersmith, a journey that had taken me an hour (with some wrong turns) in the morning. It made a mockery of Mazda&#8217;s tagline of &#8216;Swim. Bike. Run. Drive&#8217;. No spoiler intended, but I finished the race significantly quicker than that. That&#8217;s the last I&#8217;ll say on that though*, as I want to have the rest of this entry focussing on the good stuff, which was the race itself.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen a few moans elsewhere about the event being badly organised. I think that for an event serving 13000 people over the weekend, the organisation is pretty good (traffic moans above notwithstanding). Of course transition is going to be massive, and it&#8217;s a bit of a walk from swim to racking, from racking to bike mount, from bike dismount to racking again, but I experienced similar transition lengths at New Forest triathlon, for example, which is much smaller (also very good!). I thought it was a really well done event, and 19 out of 20 or so of the marshals and volunteers I came across were friendly, polite and helpful (and the other one just wasn&#8217;t the cheeriest person, but that was at 7.30am).</p>

<p>As I said in my recent post, I was feeling really well prepared going into this race, with a week in almost total alcohol abstinence (two beers, a large glass of wine, and a scotch, all week) to rehydrate. I had told friends on Saturday night about my dream goal, of 3h, but I wasn&#8217;t sure how I could do it, where I could shave the time, and so I&#8217;d be content with anything under 3h20. That was based on 40min swim, 1h35 bike, 55min run and 10min transition. I had a really bad night&#8217;s sleep on Saturday - only really got 3-4 hours sleep, and much of that was erratic. However, I knew that it was unlikely to greatly affect my race, so I didn&#8217;t worry about it.</p>

<p>What I should have done with that insomnia was to get up earlier, but instead I got up at 5.30, left around 6.15 and then worried I&#8217;d be late, I wouldn&#8217;t have time to get properly setup etc. In the event I got to ExCeL car park at 7.15, and was inside by 7.20. When I got to racking the bike, the friendly marshal asked me if I had my chip, and I must have looked worried, as she asked me if I was running late, I said I started at 8am, and she said &#8216;oh, you&#8217;ve got plenty of time&#8217;, which greatly calmed my nerves. I got my chip, racked my bike, set up my transition area, realising I&#8217;d mislaid my watch mount - but just mounted it at 90 degrees to normal, which worked fine. Nothing else to worry about.</p>

<p>So I pulled on my wetsuit to my waist, and wandered over to Swim Assembly. Short briefing, put swim cap and goggles on, pulled my wetsuit fully on, and was ready to go. I remembered my Swim for Tri advice about flushing, so jumped off the pontoon into the water, opened my wetsuit at the neck, then got out again to let it drain through. Flushing complete! I then swam very lazily over to the swim start (I remember watching people swimming over to the start and thinking that must be tiring when I watched this time last year!)</p>

<p>I found myself some reasonable space towards the back and the right, out of the way of the faster swimmers, shared some banter with other swimmers and just relaxed and took it all in. At 8am on the dot, the klaxon went, and we were off!</p>

<p>Not much to say about swimming really - a bit of a mixture of breathing every two, and breathing every three strokes, I was fairly leisurely. I had forgotten to take my wedding ring off, which was a mistake, as I worry about it falling off, and my hand got a bit cramped as I must have been tensing it to make sure it didn&#8217;t move. By midpoint I was really worried it might seize up so I took to just relaxing it completely through the whole stroke - not 100% efficient but better than cramping. There were a few bumps as people ran into me or I ran into them - nothing too serious though - I got a bit annoyed at one point, but it&#8217;s all stuff I&#8217;d got used to in openwater swim practice, so just shrugged it off and carried on in my own little race!</p>

<p>After quite a long time I finally got out of the water, ably assisted by the volunteers, and pulled my wetsuit off and began the slow shuffle to transition (several warnings of &#8216;slow down for the steps&#8217;, &#8216;slow down for the slippery floor&#8217; etc meant I was even slower than I normally run in bare feet). Got changed into the bike gear, and then slowly jogged the route to bike mount. Again, bike shoes and slippery floors don&#8217;t go together too well, so another leisurely bit!</p>

<p>Once on the bike, it took me a good while to settle into it - my calves felt quite close to cramping, so the first 14km lap to Billingsgate market, back past Excel and then back again was pretty much my warm up lap - I was quite pleased it wasn&#8217;t a sprint triathlon as I&#8217;d have finished cycling before I&#8217;d gotten into it. I got into the aero position quite regularly, except when cornering, or when my back felt tired, which was quite regularly! I really loved cycling down into the Limehouse Link, it was so much fun - of course cycling out was less so, but it is quite a gentle slope really. Cycling up to Westminster was great, was fun to cycle down the embankment that I&#8217;d only run down three weeks ago - so much easier and faster! I was really conscious of time - I knew I wanted to be doing 2:00/km and be back at Excel by 10am if I wanted a chance of hitting three hours. As the laps kept ticking by, many of them were almost on the dot of 2:00 - some of the hillier ones were slower, but as I got closer to the finish my pace picked up and I was doing 1:45 for some bits by the end (I don&#8217;t think they can have all been downhill!).</p>

<p>Into transition again, forgot which row I&#8217;d parked in (I knew it was E, so I was only one row out), had to duck under the racks with the bike, but no big deal. Changed to run shoes, took helmet, gloves and arm warmers off, and set off on the run.</p>

<p>The first time I was aware of my time on the run was near the 1km marker, and it was 10:08 then. I knew that if I ran sub 5:30 the whole time, I&#8217;d be fine. I felt quite slow on the run at the start, but then I knew that I always do off the bike, and it&#8217;s always faster than it feels. My back was not thanking me for 40km in the saddle, but again, I knew it would wear off over time. The first 5k lap seemed to pass quite quickly, and as I got closer and closer to the finish I knew it would be easy to make the time (at the 7km mark I had 24 mins left, I was tempted to have a bit of a stroll). As I got towards the finish line, and saw the clock reading 10:51 I was amazed, and must have crossed the line with such a smile on my face!</p>

<p>Peta had just missed seeing me finish, she&#8217;d been watching the race from the bridge (I did say I thought 3hours would be an exceptional time, smashing it by 10mins was unthinkable to me) but it was good to see her afterwards and have her company and share my story. I didn&#8217;t mean for her to share my suffering in the epic journey home though!</p>

<p>Final splits were 35 min swim, 1h20 bike, 47 min run, with 9 mins for transitions (I was a few seconds under 2h52), all good.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s room for improvement in all three sports, and while I can never know what I&#8217;d have managed one year ago (I&#8217;d probably have drowned in the swim for starters, making the rest of the race academic), I know that I have improved so much.</p>

<ul>
<li>That wasn&#8217;t strictly true. Sorry.</li>
</ul>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know, it&#8217;s a bit early for goals for next year. But I have no multisport races booked in for the rest of 2009, and expect my first triathlon of 2010 to be in April or May (e.g. Thames Turbo, Sevenoaks sprint). Additionally, my Ironman training plan doesn&#8217;t start until January, so I&#8217;d like things to focus on before that gets into gear.<ul><li>25 minute 1500m swim by June 2010 - ambitious, but hopefully achievable</li>
<li>45 minute 10km run by June 2010 - doesn&#8217;t seem much shorter than London Triathlon 10k, but not convinced it was the full 10k</li>
<li>Ironman Switzerland (IMCH) in sub 13 hours - not sure how ambitious this is at present!</li>
<li>New Forest tri in less than 2:30 - assuming same course</li>
<li>Bike leg of (flattish) middle distance triathlon in 2:45</li>
</ul></p>

<p>If I was doing London Triathlon in 2010 (which I&#8217;m not because it will clash with IMCH, and also I&#8217;d be doubtful anyway because the traffic is an epic nightmare) I&#8217;d be wanting to hit 2:30. I think I can shave off 20 mins in a year.</p>

<p>So, basically, be faster at everything. What do I need to work on to achieve those?<ul><li>Swim <em>speed</em> as well as technique - fitness sessions as well as technique sessions</li>
<li>Develop bike legs - at the moment I&#8217;m being overtaken by everyone, and seem to only achieve reasonable cadence in low gears</li>
<li>More variation in running to get faster - more tempo intervals, cruise intervals, and fartlek</li>
</ul></p>

<p>That&#8217;s training. In addition to training, I&#8217;d also like to do the following in the next three months: <ul><li>Maximise comfort in the run - get well-fitted shoes</li><li>Maximise comfort on the bike - have a bike fitting session</li></ul></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A year ago, while still on wordpress.org, I wrote <a href="/2008/08/16/what-would-i-want-from-an-ideal-training-blog">a few aims</a> for what I&#8217;d like to have on my ideal blog.</p>

<p>Looking at what I have now, I haven&#8217;t done so well at achieving all of that - the best I have is my race entries. I just haven&#8217;t been that motivated to do the rest, although with the Content Construction Kit and Views, I know it&#8217;s all possible.</p>

<p>What I&#8217;d like in future is<ul><li>Race splits for multi-sport - I have the data, I just need to display it</li>
<li>To start to use the Gallery</li>
<li>A bit of a redesign - the site looks a bit too slashdot-like at the moment - probably the white on darkslategray that does it!</li></ul></p>

<p>Interestingly having looked at my previous entry, the only thing I still think would be exciting to do would be to pull the training data from my Forerunner - only trouble there is that Peta borrows it from time to time!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Had a couple of great training sessions recently - a fun <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fartlek">fartlek</a> session after forgetting to charge my watch, anti-clockwise loop to Barnes Bridge and back. Varying the pace really made me feel like I was getting a proper workout.</p>

<p>Yesterday headed to Richmond Park for a last long brick session - about 25km on the bike (mostly aero once in the park) and then the 11km run loop, and then cycled home. All felt pretty good.</p>

<p>I feel like I&#8217;m actually ready for a race for a change, this one hasn&#8217;t crept up on me. I won&#8217;t be as fast as I could possibly be, my training regime hasn&#8217;t been sufficiently consistent what with wedding and honeymoon etc, but at least the last three weeks have been good.</p>

<p>After yesterday, I think my realistic bike split is more like 1hr40 (i.e. 2:30/km) - to get my goal of 3hrs total probably requires it to be nearer 1hr20 (2:00/km).</p>

<p>0:40 + 0:07 + 1:40 + 0:03 + 0:55 = 3hr25, but with some time shaved off those, hopefully I&#8217;ll get down to 3hr10. Dream would be 3hr00 though!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday, inspired by Triathlon Plus&#8217; Ironman supplement this month, I decided to sign up for Ironman Switzerland (IMCH). Austria and Germany looked good too, but both were full. My pockets are now significantly lighter, and that&#8217;s just race fees - I&#8217;ll also need to buy two flights and ship a bike.</p>

<p>So I have 53 weeks to train for IM - most plans are 20 weeks, but in the mean time I&#8217;ll ramp up the long bikes and start preparing to be able to run a marathon.</p>

<p>Race plans for next year:</p>

<p>April: marathon
June: middle distance triathlon (bala? beaver? day in the lakes?)
August: IMCH
September: vitruvian?</p>

<p>So no London triathlon next year because it will clash with IMCH, but otherwise a pretty daunting plan.</p>

<p>Can I do it? Yes. What do I think I can do it in? Individually, I reckon Swim: 1h20. Bike: 8h. Run: 4h. Could well be a 6hr run on the day though! I&#8217;d like to miss the cutoff by a few hours - 13 hours would be ideal. Of course elites can beat that time by 5 hours! Scary really.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Confined to within 15 mins of home this weekend due to being oncall for work. So thought I&#8217;d dig out the Spinervals DVDs. Tried &#8216;Into the Red Zone&#8217; first, big mistake. After about 10 minutes of tiring agonising pain, decided I should step back and go for Spinervals 1.0 Ride Strong with the Clydesdale athletes. Bit easier, but couldn&#8217;t get into it, felt low on energy and motivation.</p>

<p>So went for a run with Peta, her third session in week 1 of runners world&#8217;s run walk programme. 1 min running, 90 seconds walking, bit easier, although I did up the pace for her a little today. Good interval training for me too, although the recovery period is a little long and easy! Still, it&#8217;s intervals that will get me faster. I&#8217;ll go for a proper run tomorrow, 8-10km I&#8217;d think.</p>

<p>Just two weeks until London Triathlon. Swim - slow, but I can do it. Bike - slow, but I can do it. Run - well, best of a bad bunch, really. I&#8217;m hoping for 0:40, 1:30, 0:55 + 10 mins transitions, so 03:05. Obviously that&#8217;s a lame goal, so I&#8217;ll hope to shave 5 mins off somewhere.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In March I wrote a post called <a href="http://triathlon.willdyke.org/2009/03/05/going-backwards">Going Backwards?</a>. I was very tempted to call this one exactly the same.</p>

<p>So my T30 in July was 47 laps, which is the worst performance since November! My technique is much better than then, and I am probably more economic with my strokes, just not faster. Now I know how to breathe properly, I am breathing every three strokes pretty much all the time, to the extent where I&#8217;ve forgotten how to breathe every two.</p>

<p>The three stroke cycle of hold breath, exhale, inhale is working well for me, but I found myself getting a little bit headachey, and might need something to help my stroke maintain its quality when I need to breathe more often, either because I&#8217;m going longer or faster, or both.</p>

<p>Or perhaps I just need more practice at both fitness and technique. But definitely time to book another video analysis session!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I managed to do a lap of Richmond Park (11.5k) on my wedding day, in just over an hour, which was great! That was the last training I did until I got back from honeymoon (except for a reasonable swim from boat to check out a cave while in Greece). Consequently I was a little underprepared for the 10k a week later! I did a short run on the Monday, and then a longer run to Chiswick Bridge and back (that turned out to be 10k exactly, coincidentally). So I knew I could do it, I just wasn&#8217;t sure of the time.</p>

<p>One of the other side effects of the wedding was having lots of people to stay. It would be rude and unsociable not to stay and drink with them on their last night in England before heading back to Australia, and so my pre-race preparation seemed to involve more champagne and scotch than might be typical.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t feel too hungover on the day, but drank a fair bit of liquid before I left home, and then a bit more waiting for the start. I got to Green Park tube at around 9am for a 9.30 start, so was able to get pretty close to the start. I didn&#8217;t realise how much that would help me until I later heard that there were multiple starts. It was a pretty warm day, even at that time, so I was a little worried about my hydration strategy.</p>

<p>In the end the race started at around 9.40am, and I was just seconds behind getting through the start. I hadn&#8217;t found the chip timers (I hadn&#8217;t looked to be fair) so I was self-timing this race. I started off making sure I was feeling comfortable in my pace, running hard but hopefully not too hard, and just set off hoping to enjoy the race. With the heat and the hangover, I saw less of London than I hoped to with the course, because I was just concentrating on running well, not bumping into other people. My water stop strategy was to drink a little and then just pour the rest over my head to keep cool. Early on my splits were sub 5min/k, but apart from a couple of absolutely unrealistic splits that my watch gave me when going through a tunnel, later on they were all pretty much 5:15/k. There was a lot of great support on the race, and some of the music was excellent to run to. Finishing the race to Chariots of Fire was very cool!</p>

<p>My pre-race goal was for sub-55min, but during the race I started to hope I might do sub-50. In the end I finished on 51:06, which was pretty good considering, but I know I have the potential to achieve so much more, so looking to go sub 50 next time, and maybe sub 45 in the future!</p>

<p>After the race I had the long walk to collect medal and goodie bag (pretty uninteresting, although I&#8217;ve made use of all the free teas), and a fruitless search to try and find my mobile-less wife, so went home, happy enough but still thoughtful about what might have been.</p>

<p>There are some cool photos of me in front of the Houses of Parliament which at least show I was there, even if so little of the sights in particular were memorable!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It can&#8217;t be much less than a year ago that I bought my first copy of Runners World after recently taking up running again. With it came Triathletes World. I was even going to post it to a triathlete friend at one point, but ended up taking it on holiday to France with me as reading material instead. I didn&#8217;t even like swimming at that point, so the very idea of doing a triathlon seemed ridiculous. I&#8217;m not quite sure when that changed, but I remember thinking by the end of that long weekend in Champagne that it might not be so terrible an idea (hmm, perhaps Champagne is the clue)</p>

<p>Starting learning to swim again (I could literally just about swim a length when I started, although I have been able to swim further in the past) from July onwards meant that I missed last year&#8217;s triathlon season completely. I did, however, sign up to London Triathlon shortly after going to look at last year&#8217;s. The earliest triathlon I got around to signing up to (Sevenoaks Sprint got full while I dithered about entering) was the New Forest Triathlon, held at Ellingham Water ski lake.</p>

<p>I managed to wrap a New Forest holiday around the triathlon to take advantage of the bank holiday weekend, staying at a lovely B&amp;B in Ringwood. Friday was spent exploring the Jurassic coast, visiting Lulworth, Durdle Door and Lyme Regis. Saturday we went to Burley and also Lymington.</p>

<p>Yesterday (Sunday) morning I got up at 5.15 to have breakfast before heading to the triathlon. The patter of rain on the conservatory roof was a little annoying - the weekend had so far been gorgeous. Luckily it had dried up by the drive. The walk from car park to transition area deterred me from taking my transition box - instead I just put everything I needed in my backpack, slung my wetsuit over my shoulder and pushed the bike. Registration was quick and easy, after which I ensured my transition area was suitably set up (towel, bike shoes with pre-rolled socks in, run top, bike jacket, helmet, run shoes and race belt in place). Once I saw a few other people were in wetsuits, I changed into mine, leaving my tri-shorts underneath, applying body glide under the arms, and gingerly headed over to the lake avoiding as much gravel as possible.</p>

<p>The sun was rising over the trees bordering the lake at this point, still quite low in the sky, so I hunted areas of grass out of shadow, in the hope that standing on them would warm up my cold feet a little. To some extent it did. We then had the race briefing, including &#8216;please cycle on the left&#8217; - apparently a competitor had a fairly nasty accident last year not doing this! I then discovered I was in the first wave into the lake, and everyone started moving towards the lake. I hung back a little, wanting to avoid the cold as long as possible. However, walking into the lake, I found that the water was warmer than the ground, and the water wasn&#8217;t as unpleasant as I had feared. As a fairly poor swimmer, I headed to the rear of the scrum that is a triathlon start, and we treaded water for a minute or so, before the horn went.</p>

<p>I managed to keep a little space around me, avoiding the people around me, but ready to protect myself against thrashing feet, and after a while, the space opened up a little and the swimming got a little less cramped. I found that I was swimming fairly comfortably, not with perfect technique, but reasonable enough not to exhaust myself. I was also sighting regularly to ensure I was still on course. One thing I found was that I had little choice about which side to breathe - within minutes, the sun was high enough that I would be breathing into the sun on one side, so protected my eyes by breathing on the other side. Rounding the buoys that marked the course was often crowded, but I managed to avoid trouble. By the end of the swim, I was a little tired, but by no means shattered.</p>

<p>On leaving the lake, I felt pretty wobbly, but able to jog at a pace slightly quicker than walking to transition, where I wobbled out of my wetsuit, and into my bike gear. My transition clearly needs work, as the person next to me was in and out in a small fraction of the time I was there.</p>

<p>Once out on the bike, I started being overtaken. A lot. Some of the bikes made really cool whirring noises due to their aero wheels. Many of the bikes looked very shiny. I slowly got into the bike - I got some pretty good speeds out in the middle of the course, the winds and hills definitely played a part. The roads were lovely, and I quite enjoyed passing the group of 4 New Forest ponies, but cycling was my weakest link. I tried to keep cadence highish, and get a decent speed up, but the only bloke I overtook for longer than 20 seconds was on a mountain bike. I kept telling myself that if I got around in less than three hours (my goal times - 30 mins swim, 1:30 bike, 1 hour run, with transitions eating into those times) I could have a new bike, although I suspect that what I really need might just be more practice and a more flexible back (or perhaps a better fitting bike?).</p>

<p>Transition 2 was much quicker, racking the bike, removing bike jacket and helmet, switching shoes, moving race belt around so number was at the front (slowed down a little when the belt detached from buckle - stupid thing!).</p>

<p>The run was pretty horrendous - the first km was flat (and quick for me), the next few had a lot of uphill. My lower back was really giving me grief at this point, I was in a bit of pain. I plodded on slowly, and walked up the worst of the hills. This probably helped. By about 4km into the run, I was feeling a lot more comfortable. At the half way point, I took the offered water, swallowed some, breathed some (oops) and poured the rest over my head. Still far too many hills, so a few walk breaks at times, but most of my kilometre splits were sub 6 mins, which meant that I was doing well against goal times.</p>

<p>Peta was spectating at the finish, when I saw her waving, I returned her wave, it was lovely to see her there (she&#8217;d caught a taxi to the finish, rather than spend four hours waiting to see me during the race). I was able to gather a few more places nearing the finish, I was determined not to lose any places either, so when I noticed someone trying to pass, I picked up my pace. So did she. I picked up some more. So did she. It was an all out sprint to the finish. I have zero idea who won - there is noone with the same time in the race results. My theory is that she was from the second swim wave, so I was racing against someone who was beating me by 20 mins.</p>

<p>Peta came to meet me, I think she was torn between giving me a giant hug and staying well away from the dripping sweating monster, and we headed to get race tshirt, biscuits and tea, and we watched the prize giving, which was a first for me in a race, it did show that if you want lots of cheering, join a big tri-club!</p>

<p>I must have twisted my ankle (or sprained or strained or whatever) during the run - I even think I know when I did it, slipping off the edge of the road, and remember thinking, &#8216;ooh, that could have hurt, lucky escape there&#8217; - presumably adrenaline got me through. Hopefully it will recover quickly enough.</p>

<p>So I am now a triathlete, and hope to remain one for a good while yet. Lots of things to learn (I need to improve my cycling, my core strength, and do better on hills on the run, improve my transition times, and continue to improve my swim, which may no longer be my &#8216;weak discipline&#8217;, particularly taking proportion of race time into account).</p>

<p>Final times: swim 1100m: 31:42, bike 34km: 1:21:30, run 10km: 56:11, total: 2:49:25.
Position: 239th male (out of 263 who started, 253 finished).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have finally sat down and worked out my running schedule, so that I know at exactly what pace I should be running at during which sessions.</p>

<p>My plan is to have two Stamina runs and two Endurance runs per week. The endurance runs will be one easy run and one long run, the stamina runs will be one steady state run and either a tempo run or tempo intervals.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m currently running too fast during the tempo intervals - this means that either I need to slow down, or that my target pace is too slow - I&#8217;m calculating all of my paces from my October half marathon, nearly six months ago, so I will do another race to see if I&#8217;ve gained any speed. I plan to do next Saturday&#8217;s parkrun in Richmond Park.</p>

<p>I acknowledge that I&#8217;m unlikely to achieve 4 runs every week - however, I&#8217;d rather aim to do four and achieve three, than aim to do three and achieve two, which is what I&#8217;m currently managing. It&#8217;s time to get those weekly miles up ready for race season.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After doing Hellrunner last year, I was inspired by offroad events, and decided that an offroad duathlon, or even triathlon, was the race for me. Once I had my mountain bike, I searched for an appropriate event, and found the Merrell Mudman, and entered. The race is a 7.5km run, then 3 x 5km laps on the bike, then another 7.5km run. Later I realised that this is actually like doing Hellrunner, but where you stop half way and get on a bike for 15km, and then finish the race.</p>

<p>The leadup to this race has not gone so well - I had little time to prepare for the race itself, in terms of putting decent offroad tyres on the bike, putting elastic laces in my shoes for quick transition, and my fitness may well be down after a fairly inconsistent training schedule, packed around a weeks skiing.</p>

<p>I got up at the planned time, ready to set off at around 8.30am, to collect my hired car. Due to the lack of choice, I&#8217;d had to plump for the Honda Civic, which I imagined would actually be more spacious than the usual Audi A3. However, the A3 is a hatchback - the Civic has a boot, so I couldn&#8217;t just put the back seats down to use the entire space. In the end, the wheels went in the boot, and the bike went on a shower curtain on the back seats (I&#8217;d realised I&#8217;d have to protect the car somehow).</p>

<p>In my haste to leave, I&#8217;d forgotten to bring my race instructions, but I wasn&#8217;t too concerned, I knew vaguely where the event was, somewhere near the A311 just off J3 of the M3. However, I may have been spoilt in previous races by signage - I didn&#8217;t see a single sign on the entire road, and frantically drove around for nearly an hour looking for suitably army looking training camps (including one point where I asked a bloke with a gun for directions). In the end I finally got hold of Peta for directions, and it was simple after that, but it was nearly race start time as it was!</p>

<p>At the site, I unloaded the bike, changed into racing gear (tri shorts, tri top and running shoes) and then took rucksack, helmet and bike to racking. By the time I get to racking the race had already been going 5 minutes, so they let me prop my bike up, put my helmet on it, drop my bag and jacket and get running.</p>

<p>It was obviously no time to be worrying about position. The only thing I was really competing against was the course, with its seven hills per run lap. I&#8217;d call the first lap a draw - I overtook 3 people, while trying to maintain a sensible pace. Most of the time this pace was dictated by the course - the hills were so steep that I could only walk up them. And then too steep that I could only walk down the other side. The hills take up the middle third of the lap, so I&#8217;d picked up a reasonable rhythm again by transition.</p>

<p>At transition, I quickly took my running shoes off, put my cycling boots on, put my helmet on, and pushed my bike to the allocated mounting point, and set off. I&#8217;d already been lapped by people finishing their first bike lap by this point! I really need to work on my transitions (one of the &#8216;laces&#8217; on my boot wasn&#8217;t secure, and wrapped itself around a pedal) and perhaps more importantly, my technique - there were a few points where I pretty much fell off because I misread what the course did, and stacked it! The hills on the bike lap are fewer (thankfully, because it was hard enough walking up them, let alone while pushing a bike), but still hard, and they were the few opportunities for me to overtake. By the end of the first lap I was pretty shattered, particularly my lower back, but the second and third laps were relatively ok - I was relieved to finish on the bike, and change back to running shoes. Perhaps offroad duathlons aren&#8217;t for me!</p>

<p>I&#8217;d noticed that I was getting blisters on the first run lap, and that didn&#8217;t improve on the second. I&#8217;d made the classic error of running in untested circumstances - worse, I&#8217;d changed two things! The elastic laces were one thing - my shoes didn&#8217;t feel quite so secure in them, but that might be a matter of tweaking them. I&#8217;d also decided to run in my cycling socks, rather than my running socks - I think in retrospect that was a bad idea, as it&#8217;s the running where my feet really take the hit.</p>

<p>It didn&#8217;t really matter, as by now the course was well and truly beating me. There seemed to be more hills the second time around (it was exactly the same course) and I was running less and less. By the end of the hills, I was pretty broken, and could only manage a run-walk, probably about 50:50 (although one of my 1km splits was 6:30, compared to what I think of as a fast pace for me of 5:00, and a slow run pace of 6:00, so maybe I was running a bit more than I thought). However, I knew that whatever I did would be just as far, so running would finish it all quicker, which kept me going. I walked the last few smaller hills before it levelled off for the last 500m or so, and then just ran the rest to the finish.</p>

<p>The support in this race was fantastic - all of the marshalls were really encouraging and enthusiastic, although some of their encouragement wasn&#8217;t always helpful (e.g. not far to go now, near the end of the first bike lap). The finish was just as good, with people cheering and clapping as I finished. The cup of water was also a welcome gift. The goodie bag was one of the better ones, and there were plenty of freebies from Lucozade too. I heard a few people come in after me, so I wasn&#8217;t last, but it was certainly not my favourite race ever!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to rule out any more offroad events (I&#8217;ll certainly do more runs) but I want to improve my bike technique before I do more multisport offroad.</p>

<p>Run 1<em>: 0:54:29

<ul>
<li>I suspect these are both 5 minutes longer than they would be, due to me giving everyone else a headstart.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I did another T30 on Tuesday. I finally got around to entering the results in my spreadsheet (I occasionally miss the button when counting laps, so some of my laps take twice as long as others). The end result was quite depressing really - just 50 laps this month (after 53 last month).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried to consider where I might have gone wrong. I haven&#8217;t done much swimming recently, after a week of skiing (I&#8217;m coming around to the idea that, actually, skiing is no exercise at all once you get alright at it, although shaking your way down a red mogul run certainly uses the quads!). So perhaps it&#8217;s just a lack of practice. Taking on new techniques, particularly my new pull, might not be immediately effective. Anyway, I&#8217;ll crack on.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went for a run - it was supposed to be a recovery run in preparation for the weekend, which was just as well as, after a reasonably heavy weights session after the swim, my legs didn&#8217;t seem to want to do any pace other than sloooooow. With an average lap time of 5:48, compared to what I consider to be a fast run pace of around 5:00, it was certainly a gentle pace.</p>

<p>Had a good swim today, using a plan from swimplan.com for the first time. It was a good plan, although the endurance and aerobic sets were a little slow for me - 1m15 with 20s rest would have been glacial, given I was managing 1m00 with the same rest. Similarly the aerobic set of 1m15 with 10s rest became 1m with 10s rest. But I can tell the planning software that I thought it was a little easy and it should adjust for me next time.</p>

<p>On Saturday I have the fun of Mudman. Which I&#8217;ve realised is like Hellrunner, but half way through you stop and do a 15km bike ride. I don&#8217;t feel prepared (and I&#8217;m not prepared, I need to do a lot of work tomorrow night changing tyres over and checking the bike is ready to race), my aim is to complete. Hoping for three hours (1hr run, 1 hr bike, 1hr run), should be doable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In previous months, I&#8217;ve improved 50m per month. In my last endless pool session, I asked for tips on how to be more efficient, but I clearly hadn&#8217;t maximised those gains before the last T30, as the improvement was still only 50%. However, I&#8217;ve been practising lots, and going to 90 min swims once per week, as well as my session with Cassie at the weekend.</p>

<p>This time, I did 53 laps, 1325m, an improvement of 150m! <sup>1</sup></p>

<p>I said last month that I didn&#8217;t see 1500m within 6 months as an unattainable goal - and this just goes to show it&#8217;s within reach. I&#8217;ll need some more efficiency and speed gains in the meantime though, to get my lap times down to 30 secs. Still, I&#8217;m currently consistent - the standard deviation is 2seconds, which is the lowest its been, rather than 10seconds last month!</p>

<p>I&#8217;d be interested to do a T30 in a 50m pool to see what differences there are.</p>

<p>I also had a go at tumble turning yesterday - room for improvement, and I certainly won&#8217;t be using them during a T30 for quite some time yet, but nowhere near as horrible as the last time I tried!</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Actually, looking at my numbers from last month, I can&#8217;t believe I had an 85 second lap, that is more than 30 seconds longer than any other recovery lap, so I&#8217;ve split it into two, so the improvement is 125m. Still good!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As 2009 starts, I&#8217;m happily keeping my training on track - this blog is probably the most neglected aspect of my triathlon work at the moment. While training logs are important, I&#8217;m just getting out there and doing it, and then forgetting to write anything about it!</p>

<p>Last week I went for my first fitness session with Swim for Tri at Kensington Pool (far north Kensington, it seems, near Latimer Road tube). I had serious doubts about my ability to swim for an hour and a half, but it was an entertaining session, and I wasn&#8217;t the slowest or the least fit, so I&#8217;ll be happy to carry that on. I have trouble maintaining the discipline in swimming, as it&#8217;s so easy to stop, or not quite do as many lengths in a row as you planned. I think the next focus of my stroke will be The Catch, so I&#8217;ll look at the drills for that for tomorrow&#8217;s swim.</p>

<p>Yesterday I picked up my new mountain bike (<a href="http://www.specialized.com/bc/SBCBkModel.jsp?spid=40637&eid=107">Specialized Rockhopper Comp 2009</a>), and took it from the bike shop in Fulham for a circuit of Richmond Park. I nearly gave up tired, but popped a couple of strawberry <a href="http://www.clifbar.com/food/products_shot_bloks/">Clif Shot Bloks</a> and carried on - after that my motivation returned. My GPS decided to crash yesterday, so I have no record of the ride, other than it took me about an hour and a half from Barnes Green up to Richmond Park, round and back home. Rather than my usual road cycle route, I took the offroad Tamsin Trail around the park - great fun, although nearly an early crash as I went down a particularly muddy and slidy downhill tree section. I&#8217;m having problems with the inside of my left knee when really having to mash the gears - on one of the hills I had no choice but to mash even in first gear, and that hurt a little, so I&#8217;m hoping to get it checked out shortly.</p>

<p>Tonight I took my Petzl Myo for a test run, doing Hammersmith Bridge to Chiswick Bridge almost entirely in the dark - there was a reasonable amount of ambient light, but I was glad of my headtorch at times! I had my reflective arm strips and a rear flashing LED to increase my visibility, there were plenty of almost black cyclists about, although there were also a few that lit up like a Christmas tree in my full beam!</p>

<p>I have also started on the weights, in part to try and build up some knee strength, as well as improve my upper body strength. Hopefully I&#8217;ll see the benefits. I might look into some ski specific exercises too as my knees were certainly hit hard last year, I&#8217;ll hope extra strength, lower weight and better technique will all combine to prevent too much pain!</p>

<p>On Sunday I&#8217;m off to my first outdoor swim session, a training session with Olympic openwater swimmer Cassie Patten, arranged by the <a href="http://www.outdoorswimmingsociety.com/">Outdoor Swimming Society</a> at <a href="http://www.hackney.gov.uk/c-londonfields-lido.htm">London Fields Lido</a>. One of my minor New Years resolutions is to do at least different five outdoor swims (excluding triathlons).</p>

<p>My next race that I&#8217;ve signed up for is now <a href="http://www.humanrace.co.uk/mudman/index.html"Merrell Mudman</a> in March 2009. This will be my first multisport effort, an offroad duathlon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just wanted to create a record of what I got for Christmas 2008 (tri-related goodies only).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wild-Swim-Places-Outdoors-Britain/dp/0852650930">Wild Swim</a>, the book of the <a href="http://www.outdoorswimmingsociety.com/">Outdoor Swimming Society</a>. Came with a silicon Christmas Pudding swim hat, which looks silly and cool at the same time, I think.
Petzl Myo XP
Garmin cycle mounting kit</p>

<p>The book will be great inspiration to do more (i.e. any right now) outdoor swimming, the light should mean that I do more interesting running, and the cycle mount kit should make my rides a little more interesting, particularly once I get the Garmin cadence kit!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I did my third T30 test today. Swim 30mins, see how far you go.</p>

<p>The improvements to my efficiency have greatly improved my speed, but I&#8217;m tiring myself by trying to swim too fast. By swimming a little slower I&#8217;d still have improved my pace, but without the minute long rests needed between some laps!</p>

<p>Anyway, standard lap pace was around the 32 second mark, although average was worse. I just need to slow it down just a little.</p>

<p>So, result was 1175m, another improvement of 50m. I know there is still lots of room for improvement, I don&#8217;t think that 1500m is out of the question in the next 6 months!</p>

<p>Interestingly, the laps after my T30 were very very smooth - I was swimming almost as slowly as I could, and each stroke was almost perfect. That should be something I try and do more of, trouble is I almost need to tire myself out to slow down enough!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Haven&#8217;t updated the blog for a while - after Hellrunner, there seems to be quite a gap in my season. I&#8217;ve signed up for another tri (New Forest in May), and kept up my training as best I can (the running distances have gone down, and I&#8217;ve been trying to do more cycling and maintain the swimming).</p>

<p>I had an endless pool session last Thursday which was probably my most instructive yet. I finally understood the timing of when to start the catch, I realised I wasn&#8217;t pulling through enough back to the hip, and also that my post-recovery entry was floppy. I had been starting to doubt whether the endless pool was necessary and, while I know that they&#8217;d have picked it up in a pool, I&#8217;m not sure that I&#8217;d have been able to see the difference so quickly. Anyway, now that Swim For Tri have moved, I might have to go to their endless pool at Canary Wharf. Fitness sessions start in January.</p>

<p>I pick up a new mountain bike in the New Year - I have the Bike2Work voucher now, but as we&#8217;ll have people staying in the room where I plan to store the bike, I may as well leave it until after Christmas, especially as there may be more January discounts! Current plan is for the Specialized Rockhopper Comp Disc 2009, although I may go up a model if there are any in the sale.</p>
