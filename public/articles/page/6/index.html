  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I tried out my third pair of goggles in, what, 4 months? So far I&#8217;ve had the Aqua Sphere Seal XP (they don&#8217;t really fit very well), my Zoggs Predator (felt and looked good, but I left them behind getting changed) and today, the Aqua Sphere Eagle. Having had to use the Seal XPs again after the Predators wasn&#8217;t very pleasant, so I wasn&#8217;t too sure about getting another pair of Aqua Sphere, but I figured fit was more likely to be model-related rather than brand-related.</p>

<p>The reason I got the Eagles was because they can fit prescription lenses. I got 2 -2.50 lenses, and fitted them, and what a difference they make! Now I can actually see in the swimming pool! I can see what time it is from the far end of the pool from the clock! It&#8217;ll mean that I can use the timing clock in the pool for some timings (although I&#8217;ll still use my SportCount for more finegrained timings). Oh, and they fit and are really comfortable, too.</p>

<p>Anyway, what is far more interesting is the effect they <em>seemed</em> to have on my performance<sup>1</sup>. I just seemed to be more relaxed.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t really do too much today other than the Critical Swim Speed test - basically swim 400m, take a few mins break lightly exercising, and then swim 50m flat out. For the first time today, I swam 400m, continuously, and I could easily have done far more, I think. The 50m were probably my two fastest lengths I&#8217;ve done (who knows, I&#8217;ve never tried to go that fast <em>and</em> timed it before).</p>

<p>Critical Swim Speed results
<b>400m</b> 10m13 secs (38.37s per 25m)
<b>50m</b> 53.56s (26.73s per 25m)
<b>CSS</b> 0.63</p>

<p>Increasing CSS is a sign of increasing VO<sub>2</sub> max (i.e. I&#8217;m getting fitter). So this is another good stat to track.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> It could of course be entirely coincidental.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.swimfortri.com">Swim for tri</a> really care about <a href="http://www.tri247.com/article_4177.html">swim statistics</a>. They sent me a link to a Google Docs spreadsheet when I first signed up, but it was for the wrong email address, and they didn&#8217;t notice my reply to that effect until the other day (and I&#8217;d forgotten about it too).</p>

<p>Each time I go to the endless pool, they take my performance (stroke count over 1 minute at a certain pressure), which I believe is going down (that&#8217;s a good thing).</p>

<p>However, today I got out my <a href="http://www.sportcount.com/products.php">SportCount Chrono 100</a>, which can store 100 individual lap times, and did the T30 test - basically, swim as far as you can in 30 mins. This was for me long and hard, I had to stop every few lengths for 20 seconds or so. However, I&#8217;m relatively pleased with my overall performance. I did 43 laps in 30:07, so just under 1075 metres in total. That&#8217;s a speed of 0.6m/s, and my average lap time was around 42 seconds.</p>

<p>Looking back on the stats, I obviously started out way too fast - my first few laps were 31, 34, 35, 36, 37 seconds, and when they got down to about 40 seconds they seemed to stay consistent. I felt knackered after the first 7 or 8 laps, and yet was later easily able to do 8 consecutive laps. The notes for the test do say to aim for a steady pace - I just need to get better at slowing myself down <em>before</em> I tire myself out, not just as a result of it!</p>

<p>Next trip to the pool I&#8217;ll do my &#8216;Golf Score&#8217; - average time per lap in seconds + average stroke count per lap, over 4 laps.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure about Critical Swim Speed test - apparently you do 400m hard, then 800m warm down (hahaha), then 50m hard. I might see if the 800m warm down is compulsory or if I could do say 200m!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My plan today was to do a shorter run this week after my half-marathon last weekend - this is supposed to be a recovery week, although I&#8217;ve been ensuring I&#8217;ve kept up with swim training!</p>

<p>So I figured the easiest thing to do was get the bike out for a proper spin. I&#8217;d taken it as far as the gym before (my GPS reckoned I&#8217;d done 5km total), and even that caused my knee to ache. Looking at the cleats, the left one did look a bit wonky, so I straightened it out before today&#8217;s ride.</p>

<p>I was hoping for a sub 3 hour trip, on the basis that my route planning made it approx 10km there, a 10km run, then a 10km ride home. As I can do 10km run in less than an hour, I hoped my bike speeds would certainly  beat that.</p>

<p>It took a while to get into the groove of cycling to Richmond Park, especially as I wanted to avoid the main roads, so took the backstreets of Barnes, which were pleasant enough, once you know where to turn off. The journey to the park was pretty quick after Barnes, after a trip up Priory Lane I was in at Roehampton Gate, and took the southern loop, passing Robin Hood Gate, Ladderstile Gate, Kingston Gate and Ham Gate, cycling up some monstrous hills (for me), before enjoying the downhill!</p>

<p>At Pembroke Lodge I took a really slow transition into my running gear. This involved removing lock and running shoes from my bag, and replacing it with cycling top, cycling gloves, cycling shoes, cycle computer and saddle bag (I didn&#8217;t want to leave anything on the bike for obvious reasons, but I did lock my helmet up with the bike!). I had a quick stretch, and then set off northbound along the Tamsin Trail, before stopping after 90m to take a SIS-Go Gel. It was a bit slimy, but I managed to take it down!</p>

<p>My first couple of kms on the Tamsin Trail, passing Richmond, Cambrian and Bog Gates in the process, were damn quick (5.00/km) for me, which should perhaps have been a warning sign to slow down. I have no idea how, after cycling 12km, when your legs are supposed to be jelly, how I managed to go so quick, but I was pleasantly surprised! After crossing the road again at Sheen Gate, I was quickly back at where I entered the park, at Roehampton Gate. From there on in, things started to slow down a little, I stopped for a quick drink break, and again later for a small hill, then for some more drink, it quickly became a run/walk. However, I was still doing 6.00/km, even with the stops, so it wasn&#8217;t too terminal. However, the walk up Broomfield Hill really slowed me down, but for some reason, once I got to the top, things started to pick up again, and there were few pauses after that. I really made the most of the downhills for a change (apparently there is little training benefit in downhills, but I still need to know how to use them to my advantage!), and they took me down to Kingston Gate, from there it was flat to Ham Gate, then uphill to Pembroke Lodge.</p>

<p>At Pembroke Lodge I again made the most of an untimed transition - I desperately wanted some water as I&#8217;d made my SIS energy drink a bit too concentrated, but the queue for refreshments was long. In the end I decided to change back ready to bike home, by which time the queue was much reduced, I poured most of the water into the energy drink bottle, and then headed home.</p>

<p>There were a few small uphills from Pembroke Lodge, and then from Richmond Gate, but I really enjoyed the downhills on the cycle ride home. Some of my speeds might not necessarily have been quite within the 20mph speed limit of Richmond Park. It was pretty much downhill all the way home from Roehampton Gate, and I was home in just 30mins from leaving Pembroke Lodge, a 10km ride.</p>

<p>After Swim n Spin on Friday, I guess this was my second brick. I can tell I did it, my elbows were aching the most from hanging on, but I&#8217;ll look to get my position correct and maybe put in a few more strength exercises to help that out!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I decided to drag myself for a 2 hour session at <a href="http://www.ccsclub.co.uk/">Charing Cross Sports Club</a> (in Hammersmith, obviously). I spent most of the first hour in the pool. I took a swim plan in with me, but I didn&#8217;t really use it much - mostly I just swam a length or two at a time, trying to concentrate on good form, rolling from side to side, getting the timing right, rolling the head in the right direction, all the things we focused on in my last endless pool session.</p>

<p>After that, a quick shower and change before heading to spin class. This was my first ever spin class, and it was pretty much as hard as I expected. I cramped up a little half way through, so stopped and stretched, but was mostly able to complete what we were asked to do, although I found standing and pedalling in the lowest resistances quite tricky. It was also tricky not to just stop and freewheel as you would on any normal bike, but of course the flywheel doesn&#8217;t exactly let that happen!</p>

<p>All in all, a pretty intense couple of hours. That and not diving into the beer fridge at 5pm for a quick couple of beers means that tonight is a healthier Friday night than many! Swim and spin certainly won&#8217;t happen every week for me, but I&#8217;ll definitely try and go again (although apparently Friday night spin classes often don&#8217;t happen as there aren&#8217;t more than 2 people).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems a few people in yesterday&#8217;s half marathon hadn&#8217;t read the guide to <a href="http://badbenkc.blogspot.com/2007/09/proper-t-shirt-etiquette.html">Proper Race T-shirt etiquette</a>, as there were plenty of people wearing the t-shirt for the actual race!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got up this morning at 7.30am, an early start for me on any day, but particularly early for a Sunday! I&#8217;d been pretty good last night, mostly avoiding alcohol, although did succumb to a couple of very small glasses of wine as I figured I wasn&#8217;t in it to win it, and it probably wouldn&#8217;t do my time to much damage. I started the day with a coffee, a bowl of muesli and a couple of slices of peanut butter wholemeal toast.</p>


<p>I got Peta up at 8.30am, and we left the house shortly after 9am, to head to Knightsbridge, for a short walk to the start. I&#8217;d missed the warm up by this point, but had recently read (in the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Competitive-Runners-Handbook-Bob-Glover/dp/0140469907/ref=pd_sim_b_1">Competitive Runners Handbook</a>) that in mass starts, you can get away with treating the first couple of miles as a warm up, so I just put it behind me. The mass start was pretty busy, and after the cannon announced the start, we pretty much walked in a throng towards the start line. As this was a chip timed race, this aspect really didn&#8217;t concern me.</p>


<p>When I signed up for the half marathon, they may well have asked me my expected finish time. At that point I was in the earliest stages of starting to run, so had no idea what time I could expect. I knew novices had done 4 hour marathons, with quite a bit of training, so figured I&#8217;d just aim for half of that and added a bit of slack (I think I suggested 2h10). I don&#8217;t know whether that affected my position in the start funnel, and whether I&#8217;d have had to overtake fewer people if I&#8217;d given a better estimate. However, I probably benefitted from starting slow, so it&#8217;s swings and roundabouts really!</p>


<p>I saw Peta in the crowd just before the start line, which gave me a boost as I started the run proper. From this point on, for the next few miles, it was really a matter of maintaning a comfortable pace, and overtaking where I could. The run itself was gorgeous, passing under Admiralty Arch, past Buckingham Palace, then Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey, over Westminster Bridge and back, along the Embankment as far as Temple, before coming back along the Embankment as far as Northumberland Avenue, into Trafalgar Square, then along the Mall back towards Buckingham Palace, before heading into Hyde Park again.</p>


<p>Shortly after reentering Hyde Park, I passed Peta again, giving her a wave, and smiling as I passed. From then on it was really a lot of winding around Hyde Park. I tried to maintain a reasonable pace, and most of my kilometre splits were consistenly around the 5m30 mark. I saw Peta one more time in the middle of the run, and blew her a kiss and gave her a high five. There was a lot of support from Unicef folk around the course - towards the end, I even spotted Charley Boorman with a big group of Unicef supporters, so I acknowledged their support (as I tried to do with anyone who was cheering Unicef on).</p>


<p>I was hoping at the 10 mile point it was going to get easier (forgive the constant switching between metric and imperial - I keep my watch in metric, but the mile markers were, well, in miles), because the Competitive Runners&#8217; Handbook makes the point &#8216;now you just have to do a 5K run&#8217;. I was flagging at this point, but just wanted to keep going - breaking into a walk wouldn&#8217;t be a failure in itself, but breaking into a walk without actually <i>needing</i> to would have felt like slacking. Anyway, I just kept going, it was hard work, but somehow I did it. I&#8217;d hoped the last mile would feel easy too, but no, it was uphill, and the last few hundred metres were a nightmare. Peta was waving here too, which helped a little but really I just had to dig in and just concentrate on keeping going - I really did feel that collapsing before the finish in a dramatic manner and having to crawl over the line would not be totally out of the question.</p>


<p>However, I did get over that line, and my watch said somewhere around 1:55 (I forgot to stop it!), the chip time isn&#8217;t yet available but it was definitely sub 2 hour, so I totally made my goal, which rocked! I sat down just after the finish line to avoid falling down, had a little water, but not too much. The weather was a real factor today - the forecast said it would be 18C, but it may have been more - for an Autumn&#8217;s day, it was gorgeous - unless you have to run 21.1km. Because of the heat, and resulting sweat, and desire to avoid hyponatremia, I wanted to make sure I wasn&#8217;t diluting my body&#8217;s water too much, so poured water over my head to reduce the need to sweat, and looked for the nearest energy drink over the finish line.</p>


<p>After a bit more sitting down, I gave Peta a call, and we met up to head for the Unicef tent. After a sit down and bit [sic] to eat, we headed home, although there was a minor diversion as I did the <a href="http://www.iamsuperchick.com/">Superchicks&#8217;</a> very useful cooldown routine while Peta enjoyed the <a href="http://www.deckchairdreams.org/">Deckchair Dreams</a> deckchairs!</p>


<p>I&#8217;m now elevating my legs while enjoying the breeze on my toes as I enjoy the recliners in our lounge, making the most of the unusual Autumn weather in shorts and sandals. All in all I&#8217;m very happy with today&#8217;s race, especially given the temperature.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After my excellent <a href="/2008/09/28/what-a-run">run</a> on Sunday, today&#8217;s proved to be quite a contrast. I had taken a look out the window prior to my run, figured it was drizzling a bit and so headed out for my run.</p>


<p>On getting outside, I quickly realised it was actually drizzling quite heavily, but not one to worry about such things, carried on regardless. I really don&#8217;t mind the rain too much, it keeps me cool, and keeps me motivated to run faster to escape the rain when running for a distance, rather than a time.</p>


<p>I did my usual lunchtime circuit via Putney and Hammersmith Bridges, quite enjoying avoiding the bigger puddles, although I think this was my worst soaking on a run (I&#8217;ve never had wet underwear while running before, or even got my feet wet come to that). Once I&#8217;d got back near work, I headed to grab some food for Peta and me. I got my sandwiches quite quickly, but while waiting for a baked potato, the rain came down even harder, and I had to run back to work covering my sandwich bag to stop it disintegrating in the rain!</p>


<p>All in all, a fast, mostly bearable, very wet run today!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My goal today was to run a half marathon, to check that I could do one, and see in what time. I also wanted to try a nutrition idea, as well as try the Royal Parks Half energy drink (Orange Powerade).</p>


<p>I had a quick look before the run with <a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/">Google Maps Pedometer</a> to plot a 21km run, and was pretty happy with the result - I&#8217;ve basically found a new expandable route that I&#8217;ll be able to do again and again.</p>


<p>My route today started in the usual place for me - the south side of Hammersmith Bridge. It even headed in a fairly usual direction, towards Barnes Bridge. Carrying on, as with previous runs, I passed Chiswick Bridge and then Kew rail bridge, before reaching Kew road bridge. This was my turnaround point last week for what turned out to be a 14km run but today I carried on, as planned, along the path that skirts the outside of Kew Gardens.</p>


<p>It was at this point that I tried my nutrition, jelly beans. Big mistake - jelly beans appear to need a lot of moisture to eat, something in short supply when running! It didn&#8217;t stop me, just annoying really - it&#8217;s possible that I might get away with them in the race if I treat them like Gels, and have them just before a water stop, but I won&#8217;t bother. I carried on, past the Old Deer Park, then past Richmond Lock, Twickenham rail bridge and Twickenham road bridge. At Richmond bridge, I left the river to head up Richmond Hill, stopping at the start of the hill to buy some Powerade Orange. The theory here was that I&#8217;d be walking most of the hill anyway, so it was a good time to get some liquid down. However, Richmond Hill seems to have become a lot flatter in the last few years (or perhaps somehow I got fitter by stopping smoking and starting running, one of the two), and I was able to run up most of the hill, breaking in to a walk when I wanted some more drink. It was only later that I remembered the handy nipple-type thing on the top of the bottle to allow me to run and drink! So, at the top of the Hill, along the Terrace, passing the gorgeous view of the river below, and then into the Park</p>


<p>I basically ran along Sawyer&#8217;s Hill, the road that runs across the top side of the Park. One of my favourite things about this road is that it&#8217;s not at all rare to see deer - today I saw a gorgeous lone stag standing across the road to my right, and later to my left, large numbers of deers lying in the sun, looking magnificent. The cyclists going down Sawyers Hill looked like they were having a great time, those going up, not so much. I was mostly heading downwards now, past the junction that leads to Sheen Gate, towards Roehampton Gate. From there, it was follow the cyclepath, past The Priory, then to Barnes Station. From there, I decided I couldn&#8217;t quite take the quickest route home and make it 21km, so I headed towards Barnes Bridge Station, across Barnes Bridge, and then along my by now well known run haunts of Dukes Meadow, Corney Reach, past the Fuller&#8217;s Brewery along Chiswick Mall, passing the Eyot to the right. It&#8217;s then pub central as I pass the Black Lion followed by the Old Ship, into Lower Mall and then the Dove, Furnivall Gardens where the Rutland and Blue Anchor are in easy reach. Today, I made my target of 22.1km (I wasn&#8217;t counting my 1km warm up run) in Furnivall Gardens themselves, which I was pleased with!</p>


<p>All in all, a spectacular run, helped by today&#8217;s gorgeous weather, and the timing where I had the sun low over the river at Kew, but still enough light to <i>just</i> get me home in daylight!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I asked <a href="http://triathlon.willdyke.org/2008/08/16/what-would-i-want-from-an-ideal-training-blog">What would I want from an ideal training blog</a>. Certainly the free <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">Wordpress</a> blog wasn&#8217;t quite doing it for me, so deciding whether to stay with Wordpress or move onto one of the many other CMSs (e.g Joomla, Drupal). In the end, what swung it for me was discovering a quick way of creating custom content types, and views on content, via relatively simple plugins, in Drupal. These plugins are <a href="http://drupal.org/project/cck">CCK</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a>. Similar things might be available for Wordpress, or even Joomla, but I just didn&#8217;t find them.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve been spending some time over the last few weeks to work out how to migrate my free Wordpress blog to a paid Drupal blog. I&#8217;ve used a <a href="http://prime357.net/node/23">Wordpress to Drupal converter</a> (which works best with a blank database - I had to tweak a few tables by hand). I found a company called <a href="http://www.5quidhost.co.uk/">5 quid hosting</a> to host my site (at much less than £5 per month) with unlimited subdomains and databases, and a reasonable amount of diskspace. And now, finally, I&#8217;ve transferred the source over from my laptop&#8217;s test system, and it appears to work!</p>

<p>Current plans are to replace the content that I did lose in the migration (mainly the About Me and Links sections), and then to work on the reasons for moving - custom content types including Races, Training Log entries, and using data for those to create Personal Best sections, Recent Training sections, etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been a bit slack. I have a number of reasons for that - Australia, oncall, teaching all week, but I just haven&#8217;t got out the runs, or the swims even, that I would have liked.</p>

<p>However, that stops now. I&#8217;ve had a really inspiring weekend - I rode my new bike for the first time, and it felt good - getting used to drop handlebars could take a while, but there&#8217;s no other way to brake! I went for a swim, and felt really good in the water, and managed six consecutive lengths using mostly good style, as well as completing a number of drills.</p>

<p>Today I ran just 14km. The first half of it seemed to be pretty much entirely at 5:00/km pace, which is a phenomenal speed for me - I would have considered that almost sprinting three months ago! The second half seemed to be at a more reasonable and maintainable 5:30/km. For my goal of a 2 hour half marathon, I need to do 5:41/km. Most important is just maintaining a good speed that I can do for the entire run, and not blow up too early!</p>

<p>Anyway, a great weekend, to be followed by good solid training for the next two weeks, and then taper week.</p>

<p>Goals for next week:<ul><li>Run 3 times - one tempo run, one normal run, and one long run of perhaps Putney - Kew loop</li><li>Swim three times</li><li>Book next Swim for Tri video session</li><li>Plan next seasons runs and triathlons</li></ul></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been a bit unsure about how fast I&#8217;d be able to do the half marathon, but recent runs suggest that a 2 hour goal is not impossible for me.</p>

<p>I was planning on just wanting to finish, but in my heart, I know that I do want to do it in under 2 hours, so I&#8217;m declaring that as my goal for the race. I&#8217;m not going to be devastated if I don&#8217;t achieve it, but I will be really pleased if I do!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Someone somewhere just doesn&#8217;t want to me to be prepared for this half marathon.</p>

<p>After two hot weeks in Australia, I returned to a week of oncall. After that week, I&#8217;m spending 4 days this week at Wembley training. Days promise to be long (probably 8.30 - 6.30 at the earliest), so fitting in runs and swims this week will be tricky alongside social events.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s the excuses out of the way. I ran 18.5km total yesterday (usual 1km warm up), did a half hour swim session today. I&#8217;ll do a Sunday run and see if I can motivate myself for a swim on Friday morning.
As for other runs, I&#8217;m busy Tuesday through Saturday evenings, so it&#8217;ll either have to be before work or at lunch somehow!</p>

<p>Met most of my goals last week, except only did 2 runs, and still haven&#8217;t come up with a new training schedule. My latest excuse is that the FIRST training plans rely on a race time of some kind. Good one, eh.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Goals for last week:<ul><li>Swim at least once</li><li>Run at least twice</li></ul></p>

<p>Thu: Ran from Clovelly Beach to just North of Bondi Beach via the coastal path, and back. A beautiful but hilly route in cool weather, giving a pretty much perfect run of around 7km including warm up.
Sun: A repeat of the previous Sunday&#8217;s effort, a bit more running this time - another 15km run/walk.</p>

<p>So, one goal met, one goal failed - no swimming at all in Australia</p>

<p>With Australia over, it&#8217;s time to get back to normal. Early indications are that this week will just about get me back on track, I should achieve 3 runs, even if not 2 swims, and I hope to return to normal training sessions from next week.</p>

<p>This week is an oncall week, so I&#8217;m keeping my goals realistic (going for a run or a swim after work is much less practical, for example)</p>

<p>Goals for this week: <ul><li>Run three times</li><li>Swim once</li><li>Do some work on Wordpress plugins!</li><li>Produce a new training schedule - this has been a missed goal several times</li></ul></p>

<p>Mon: Swam 30 mins
Tue: Ran 30 mins
Wed: Swam 40 mins - followed by gym
Thu: Ran 30 mins</p>

<p>Mon: Ran/walked 14km (including 1km warm up beforehand) - very scrappy run though, probably due to poor nutrition and hydration, the effects of 24 hours in flight, and warm afternoon weather. Walked up the hills, and had to walk for a bit as so tired. Lowish heartrate suggests lack of energy.
Thu: Ran 7km continuously.
Sun: Ran/walked 15 km</p>

<p>Goals for next week:<ul><li>Swim at least once</li><li>Run at least twice</li></ul>
Ok, nothing amazing, but being on holiday with plenty to do does shift the focus somewhat! I have managed to do plenty of reading, at least, so should be able to come up with some training schedules soon.</p>

<p>Mon: Swam 30 mins
Tue: Ran 30 mins - to Putney Bridge, across, and then back
Wed: Swam 30 mins
Thu: Ran 30 mins - to Putney Bridge, across, and then back
Sat: First consultation session with <a href="http://www.swimfortri.com">SwimForTri</a> - one hour in endless pool deconstructing my technique
Sun: Ran 11.5km in one hour in one go (plus 1km warm up beforehand) - very pleased with this result, with 8 weeks to go before my half-marathon, looks like sub 2hr is not a completely insane goal.</p>

<p>So, another pretty successful week!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m flying to Australia on Friday night, so not sure how the weekend&#8217;s long run will happen, but I&#8217;ll be on holiday, so should have plenty of time for running and swimming</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m quite enjoying using Wordpress to manage my training blog. I&#8217;m only using the basic functionality, and I&#8217;d like more training specific components</p>

<p>What I&#8217;d ideally like is: <ul></p>

<pre><code>&lt;li&gt;A way of entering what I've bought, where, for how much, and for what, as a means of managing my expenditure, and of course of displaying that information (I already have a private Expenses page, this would replace that)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way of easily entering my Training Log information in a form, and then automatically updating the table. Even better, that component could pull from Garmin Connect so I don't have to enter everything (although I might choose to correct it (e.g. sometimes I forget to stop my timer before walking home, so my run distances would be exaggerated)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'd like that same information in a side bar - e.g. Week 10: Swam 400m, Cycled 20km, Ran 20km&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal bests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Race status&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></ul></p>

<p>I&#8217;d have to go to a commercial platform for this functionality, and probably have to write the plugins myself, but neither of those is insurmountable - more of an issue is finding the time to research and code the extensions.</p>

<p>However, this entry will help me focus my attention on what I actually want on top of basic functionality.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was hoping to practise with my clipless pedals today. Unfortunately the vendors of my triathlon cycling shoes sent me shoes two sizes too big. So that&#8217;s another weekend not trying out my bike (which means that I won&#8217;t realistically be riding it before Australia). How frustrating!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I suspect I might be overtired from four days in a row exercising, as this definitely wasn&#8217;t my best session, I managed to do one set of four consecutive lengths, but never quite found the energy to do a second set. I was also a bit pushed for time, which didn&#8217;t help.</p>

<p>I did have an experience practising tumble turns. Oh how my nose hurt as I went upside down! I&#8217;m pretty certain I got zero (or negative) performance benefit from tumble turning, but I have start practising it at some point!</p>

<p>I always thought of swimming as being the cheapest of the three sports, and hoped I&#8217;d make do with trunks and goggles. But no, now I have two pairs of goggles, a lap timer, and am expecting a kick buoy (a float that is used as a pull buoy to support the legs, or as a kickboard), fins and paddles. Actually, two kick buoys due to a mix-up. I&#8217;ll dispose of one one way or another.</p>

<p>This will be the last of my regular swimming updates. As I now have swim plans etc. to work with, and drill and fitness sessions to do each week, I suspect &#8216;did the drills that swimfortri told me to do&#8217; and &#8216;did the fitness session provided by swimfortri&#8217; will quickly become dull for me and the reader.</p>

<p>However, just as I occasionally write about interesting runs, I&#8217;ll be writing about swims that I want to remember for whatever reason. I&#8217;ll almost certainly be writing about the deconstruction of my technique resulting from the Endless Pool sessions.</p>

<p>Swimming will hopefully just become part of my training routine, like my runs so quickly have!</p>

<p>Still, I&#8217;m hoping to get on the bike soon (this weekend maybe?) so maybe I can replace Swimming - Day X with Cycling - Day Y (oh noes, I fell off my bike again!).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, I&#8217;m now signed up with <a href="http://www.swimfortri.co.uk">Swim For Tri</a> for a sixth month course, which should take me from Novice to Advanced. The course incorporates weekly training schedules to complete on my own, including both fitness and drills sessions, six sessions in an Endless Pool to have my technique videoed and a DVD of drills.</p>

<p>The next stage after that will probably be a second six month course incorporating open water swimming.</p>

<p>They didn&#8217;t laugh at me for saying that I wanted to be able to do 1500m in open water within a year, which I take to be a good sign!</p>

<p>I have my first endless pool session booked for Saturday at 11am. So I should probably try for a quiet night on Friday!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Cut short a little way, because there was an aquafit session in the pool starting about 25 mins after I arrived, so managed to get 20 mins in.</p>

<p>Did four consecutive lengths twice, mostly maintaining reasonable form and style. I timed the second set, and I think I managed 2:30, but as per usual, I might have misread the clock. I really do need a lap timer.</p>

<p>Swum several other lengths, trying out various paces and techniques, but nothing as formal as drills yet. I have been in contact with SwimForTri, so am waiting to hear back on a quote now.</p>
