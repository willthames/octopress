  <div class="entry-content"><p>How fortuitous. One of my favourite sports writers, Matt Fitzgerald, has done a 20 week iron distance training plan in this months Triathlete Europe. That takes about 8 weeks off my training plan, meaning a start in April rather than February.</p>

<p>Now obviously that doesn&#8217;t mean I can doss around for the next three months, but I can go to Running School (a Christmas present from my lovely wife) and possibly even treat myself to a swim training day too.</p>

<p>I do need to get back on the bike and back in the pool in January though, I can&#8217;t keep being slack!</p>

<p>I also learnt about <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/article/1,7124,s6-238-244-255-624-0,00.html">Yasso Intervals</a> today, which also totally fit with the principle of reducing variation. While they might not correlate with a marathon after 8 hours on the go, they should correlate with the &#8216;add a sixth of the time&#8217; school of thought (so if I can do 3:30 800s, I should be able to do a 3:30 standalone marathon and 4:03 iron distance run leg)</p>

<p>Next step is to start formulating a proper training plan focussing on my key workouts and fitting in other things such as holidays etc, so I&#8217;m totally ready to start hard graft in April, while improving technique in the interim.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For 2011 I plan to do:<ul><li>London Olympic distance in less than 2:30 (0:30, 1:10, 0:50, with transitions coming out of that somewhere!)</li>
<li>Richmond Parkrun in less than 0:22</li>
<li>Challenge Henley in less than 12 hours - this may not seem ambitious after a 12:17 Ironman Switzerland but there are a <em>lot</em> more hills. (1:20, 6:40, 4:00)</li>
<li>6k pool swim in 2:00</li>
<li>Go sub 1:40 in a half marathon</li></ul> How do I plan to achieve this? Obviously I want to improve my running, hence the improvements on my run times - this will be done by increasing frequency, and working on improving form, while minimising injury risk.</p>

<p>My bike performance should have a good baseline from last year, but I&#8217;ve let it slide - I need to do a lot of miles and that will mean rollers, turbo and long rides before summer even starts.</p>

<p>Swim will also be built on volume rather than technique - overdistance training, regular testing, plus some speed work. Biggest issue is probably feel for the water, so sculling, doggy paddle and distance.</p>

<p>Races planned for next year include: Richmond Half Marathon, Blenheim Sprint, London Olympic and Challenge Henley. No middle distance tri planned yet (Bala is the weekend after Blenheim, which might be a big ask, A Day in the Lakes is probably too hilly and badly timed for me).</p>

<p>I guess this means <a href="http://willthames.org.uk/2010/12/03/ambivalent-about-iron-distance">I&#8217;m not so ambivalent now.</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s difficult to write this one up, but I have to admit, I was beaten by this challenge. The first day I didn&#8217;t run (the 21st) was due to a slightly sore little toe (of all things), a very minor Achilles niggle and those combined with a lack of motivation to do more treadmill running meant I stopped.</p>

<p>I did worse than originally hoped, but I stuck it out longer than I felt I needed to given the weather. The point of the challenge for me was to enjoy running every day - I knew I wouldn&#8217;t enjoy every run, but I didn&#8217;t enjoy any treadmill run.</p>

<p>After I stopped, I meant to carry on running regularly, but my toe got worse (to a point where it was so sore that I could barely walk) so I rested it, and will barely run at all until it&#8217;s properly checked out next week as running did seem to stop it improving, and it&#8217;s much better at the moment but the underlying issue is still there.</p>

<p>I learnt a lot - I can run more often than I have done before. I&#8217;m not sure I need to though, unless I want to stop being a triathlete and start being a runner, which I&#8217;m not sure I do. Racing both sports will always mean I&#8217;m worse at running than I would be if I concentrated solely on running, but I suspect more injury and less enjoyment would probably also happen.</p>

<p>Of the runs below, the first was in snow, the second on a treadmill and the third on still a bit icy pavements (little enough to make me think it was a good idea, too much to actually be that good idea)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Successfully completed another week of running, this time without a visit to the treadmill, thankfully. Was thinking of doing a 5km run today but having suffered through a 12km at very slow pace, very glad I didn&#8217;t!</p>

<p>Seem to be doing quite well at alternating easy and hard days, which is good as it allows recovery.</p>

<p>Tried using a foam roller for the first time today to try and allow my calves some release, will see how my legs appreciate that tomorrow.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Someone on <a href="http://www.tritalk.co.uk">Tritalk</a> suggested a challenge for December, an <a href="http://www.tritalk.co.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?t=74357">Advent daily run challenge</a>.</p>

<p>This started on Advent Sunday, meaning it includes a bit of November too, so yesterday I completed my first week ever of running daily. Before now I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve run on consecutive days more than a couple of times, if that.</p>

<p>The snow didn&#8217;t help, of course. I&#8217;m planning on getting some Springyard Cross Country ice grippers to run on ice, but this week I could only hit the treadmill for two days before the thaw.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Typically only two possibilities are mentioned for a post-Iron racer - &#8220;Never Again&#8221; or &#8220;Iron Addict&#8221;. I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be in the former camp, and thought I&#8217;d lean more to the latter, but I&#8217;m just not that bothered about doing another just yet. One problem is that none of the UK long distance races seem very suitable in terms of timings (either too early or too late). I could look at IMUK or Outlaw but neither are as convenient as Forestman or Henley.</p>

<p>I guess I&#8217;m just keen to do other things next season too - my first Sprint triathlon (yeah, a bit crazy to do a first Sprint after Ironman), maybe a standalone marathon, maybe an ultra run, maybe the <a href="http://www.fredwhittonchallenge.org.uk/route.php">Fred Whitton challenge</a>. I&#8217;ll keep up my swimming too, to keep myself in challenges. I&#8217;d love to do A Day in the Lakes, and Bala was so good this year that I&#8217;d consider doing it again - I&#8217;ve said it before, but I really do enjoy middle distance.</p>

<p>I also need to ensure my supportive wife doesn&#8217;t feel like a tri-widow - Ironman training schedules don&#8217;t lead to the most fun weekends!</p>

<p>Anyway, I will be back to the iron distance, just maybe not in 2011.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My run volume has been well down over the last couple of weeks due to, of all things, what seems to be foot eczema on my little toe. I&#8217;ve been trying to keep it dry and prevent too much rubbing of it, so I&#8217;ve not been swimming or running. It seems to be getting better now, so I&#8217;m hoping to get back to a bigger volume soon.</p>

<p>I initially thought this might have started from a blister from my five fingers, which would have been ironic as my little toe is too far away from the ends of the shoes to even reach the shoe toes. However, it could be an allergic reaction to either a cat scratch or the shoes themselves!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve ordered some toe socks to provide some protection, but I won&#8217;t stop running in them barefoot altogether.</p>

<p>I have come to the realisation that while I think barefoot running is a good motivator to improve form, it is not essential, so I&#8217;m going to mix it with some new Newtons. My &#8216;clown&#8217; shoes are off to ebay as they don&#8217;t promote forefoot striking. I&#8217;m clearing out four pairs of running shoes this weekend (two to ebay, two to shoes4africa via Running Shoes London when I get there)! That&#8217;ll leave my new Newtons, my Vibrams and my Adidas trail shoes.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not doing Hellrunner next weekend now, as my run volumes have been so low, and I still haven&#8217;t broken the 5km barrier - doing a 16km run, offroad, trying to maintain good technique just isn&#8217;t going to happen. I might make it up to myself by aiming for the London Ultra run at 50km, but I&#8217;m not going to force my run volumes up too fast, so that might be overly ambitious - to be honest, getting back to past distances and past speeds would be a good start.</p>

<p>My cycling and swimming motivation hasn&#8217;t been great - I think I need something to aim for as I&#8217;m just struggling to even bother at the moment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So common perceived wisdom is that you should build very slowly into barefoot/minimalist running to avoid injury - increasing volume by 10% per week. In my first week I did about a kilometre, doubling that would take ten weeks at that rate.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to build up gently but last Sunday I did 2km, and today I did 5km. Last week I did under 4km, this week I&#8217;ve done more like 12km.</p>

<p>I am going to take the next couple of runs quite easy - the 5km today was a bit too long, my form was poor towards the end, and so I should ensure I can do the distance properly before moving up further.</p>

<p>But I am quite excited that soon I&#8217;ll be able to get back to my old regular runs of the Putney Bridge loop (6.5km) and the Barnes Bridge loop (7.5km). Then I&#8217;ll keep my midweek runs fairly constant and start increasing the long run distance.</p>

<p>I had my first venture to the other side of the river earlier this week - running in the mud was fun (but you quickly get wet toes!) but the surface certainly keep you on your toes (haha), increased awareness to avoid sharp stones is essential!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As my run volume dramatically declines, so my need for aerobic activity increases, and I&#8217;ve returned to the pool and perhaps more radically, the bike. I really enjoyed my first group pool speed session in over 18 months and swam the fastest I think I&#8217;ve ever swum. My bike session yesterday had some <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/54370381">very interesting pace characteristics</a> for what should have been two evenly paced threshold intervals</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve really enjoyed reading what I call <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Run-Mind-body-Method-Running-Feel/dp/1934030570/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1288134711&sr=8-1">Run by Feel</a>, and have embraced some of its less obvious philosophy wholeheartedly and want to shape my entire triathlon training programme around it.</p>

<p>One key point from the book is that the amount of variation in most training programmes is actually massively greater than is best. For example many Kenyan runners have a very simple training programme (simple to follow conceptually, much harder to follow athletically!) and get great results. Also, the less variation, the easier it is to measure progress. And a testing session is almost always a good training workout, as long as you&#8217;re not in need of a recovery session!</p>

<p>As such over the next few weeks I want to define some key workouts so that I can just pick six plus workouts per week, follow them, and track progress against previous iterations. I will ignore running for now as my key workout is &#8216;Run at a comfortable pace until the slightest perception of niggles&#8217; and even that might be going at it too hard.</p>

<h4>Swimming</h4>


<ul><li>Testing sessions: 1500m-2500m time trial (looking to turn current 1500m pace into future 2500m pace), also CSS test.</li><li>Interval sessions: 100m warm up, 10 x 100m + 1 lap rest, 100m cool down. Overglider session 2.</li><li>Could use some technique sessions too</li></ul>


<p>One key point is that the first interval session, and a 1500m time trial can be done in a lunch hour, so could fit in a three session week.</p>

<h4>Cycling</h4>


<ul><li>Testing session: 15 min warm up, 2 x 20 minute threshold interval, 5 min cool down</li><li>Pick a couple of spinervals DVDs to do on the turbo trainer</li><li>The aero spinerval is great on the rollers</li>
<li>Get outside once in a while!</li></ul>


<h4>Running (once I improve)</h4>


<ul><li>7-8km tempo run - looking to improve on speed</li><li>Long run - looking to maintain pace over longer distances</li><li>Track intervals - pick two and alternate</li></ul>


<p><a href="http://www.mcmillanrunning.com/mcmillanrunningcalculator.htm">McMillan&#8217;s pace calculator</a> will help me work towards ideal goal running paces, I&#8217;ll have to find similar for swim paces. I&#8217;m still waiting for Garmin to release MetriGear&#8217;s Vector power meter so that I can finally get some decent info on the bike (at least the rollers will be consistent week on week)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my <a href="http://willthames.org.uk/2009/08/03/2009-2010-goals">2009-2010 goals</a>, I listed my goals for this season just gone. How did I do? <ul><li>25 minute 1500m swim by June 2010 - FAIL. My swimming endurance and technique have improved this year, but that hasn&#8217;t translated into improved times - just longer distances</li>
<li>45 minute 10km run by June 2010 - FAIL didn&#8217;t even try this. The running calculator for my HM at the weekend suggests that I could do a 46:07 which is not success.</li>
<li>Ironman Switzerland (IMCH) in sub 13 hours - SUCCESS! 12:17, smashed it.</li>
<li>New Forest tri in less than 2:30 - no idea how well I&#8217;d have done at this! I wouldn&#8217;t call this success or failure (perhaps failure to try)</li>
<li>Bike leg of (flattish) middle distance triathlon in 2:45: I did Bala in 3 hours, which is quite close to this goal; I&#8217;m saying this one wasn&#8217;t a success or failure either</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Hmm, that&#8217;s not great - two FAILs, one SUCCESS and two uncertain outcomes. What can I learn from this? That my goals need to be more relevant. Who cares about a 45min 10k or 25min 1500m swim when you&#8217;re training for Ironman which is all about endurance, not speed.</p>

<p>I succeeded at my main objective, the sub-13 hour Ironman, and I&#8217;m also happy with my sub-1:45 half marathon, not to mention the surprise of smashing the six hour barrier in Bala (I predicted 6:30!), and my new 5K Richmond Park PB, shaving a minute off. My six hour London Duathlon was a triumph of stubbornness. I&#8217;m happy with all of my race outcomes (I can&#8217;t think of a single race where I&#8217;m disappointed in my performance), which is surely the true test of . I&#8217;ve had a good year, I&#8217;m a bit concerned improving on it will be hard, but I suspect there is so much potential for improvement that I&#8217;ve yet to realise.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I officially declare my racing season over. That&#8217;s not to say that I won&#8217;t race again this year, but it really is time to start the off-season.</p>

<p>This year I&#8217;ve decided to concentrate on form in my off-season - use the break as an opportunity to go destroy my form and rebuild it from scratch.</p>

<p>I plan to train solely* in my brand new Vibram Five Fingers KSO that I picked up from Ten Point at the weekend. I&#8217;ll keep my Green Silence for races for now, and if it gets too cold I reserve the right to put on warmer shoes, but for now, I want to train as close to barefoot as I personally dare in London.</p>

<p>Running in them just on a treadmill was strange enough (although of course the feedback loop on a treadmill is always going to be terrible). Running on hard surfaces should promote forefoot striking, and that should radically reduce my injury risk (although at a cost of radically increasing my injury risk in the very short term; having said that the impact is different - any potential muscle pain should be far shorter term than knee damage)</p>

<p>I need to build up to running in these slowly. I&#8217;ve been wearing them on the walk to work, and tomorrow I hope to have a jog. I don&#8217;t plan to run very far - I don&#8217;t know how far that will be yet, but I&#8217;ll be listening to my body <i>very</i> carefully.</p>

<p>If I don&#8217;t lose my fitness, I will do Hellrunner as planned, but for now, my priority is form over fitness. I&#8217;ll use swimming and cycling to try and at least maintain my aerobic fitness, even if I lose some run endurance.</p>

<li>see what I did there? ;)</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My first race was the first Royal Parks Half Marathon in 2008, where I was very pleased going under 2 hours, finishing in 1:55. Since then I&#8217;ve done a lot more running, including my first marathon at the tail end of Ironman Switzerland.</p>

<p>However, the last few weeks haven&#8217;t been entirely confidence-inducing - I&#8217;ve had some calf issues that have disrupted my training such that most of my shorter runs haven&#8217;t been pain-free (interestingly some of my longer runs I have managed to push through the muscle pain). Last week had been pretty reasonable with an excellent (but not very fast) intervals session and tempo run.</p>

<p>Given that most of my leg pain has been after setting off too fast, my plan for the race was to start slow and finish fast, warming up during the race. I did participate in the British Military Fitness warmup, after which I felt tired before the race even started!</p>

<p>A former colleague, Andy, was also doing the race, and we had very similar goals, hoping to get 1:45, so our plan was to run the race together as much as possible.</p>

<p>At 09:30, the race started, and about three minutes after, we crossed the start line. Andy and I ran a fairly solid pace, staying around the 5:00/km pace for the first few kms, a bit faster than planned. However, I felt good and the pace felt easy enough that I wouldn&#8217;t blow up. We avoided other runners, and didn&#8217;t bother with water stops, heading through Parliament Square, over Westminster Bridge and back, and then along the Embankment. Our pace headed as low as 4:45/km at times, but it was never particularly uncomfortable.</p>

<p>At around the 8km mark, Andy wasn&#8217;t feeling too good so dropped back, and I just pushed on, aiming to maintain a good speed. I kept a good eye out for Peta as I entered the park around the 10km mark, but she spotted me. I also saw her a bit later, probably around the 15km mark as I went past the lake again, so early enough not to be looking too shocking!</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t really feel much need for water in this race - I took some twice in the second half, mainly to wash down my shot bloks and pour over my head for cooling. Temperature wise it was fairly comfortable, much cooler than 2008.</p>

<p>At around kilometre 18, I really just had to dig in and push on. However, in spite of how hard I thought I&#8217;d been working, kilometre 20 was the fastest of the lot, as I did 4:40 just before the finish line.</p>

<p>In terms of perceived exertion, on a 10 point scale the first half was around 5, and it went up to around 9.5 in the final km, even the sprint across the line didn&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;d hit 10.</p>

<p>I was very happy with 01:42, but I know that I have the potential to do better; just as with my last Royal Parks race, had I had less traffic, I could have gone faster. My negative split (my last ten km were two minutes faster than my first ten km) was a bit too extreme. However, it was good to feel confident about my pace early on and not blow up.</p>

<p>This was the most enjoyable run I&#8217;ve had in weeks, I was pleased my calves didn&#8217;t stiffen up and I ran without any significant pain, although there was some suffering towards the end. My confidence is skyhigh at the moment, and I plan to use that confidence to set some proper goals for the next year. But that&#8217;s another post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve realised over the last few weeks that my philosophy of running is changing almost daily - there are so many things I&#8217;ve lost faith in and so many things I&#8217;ve started to consider</p>

<p>Stuff I used to do but don&#8217;t any more:
* Gait analysis
* Stretching
* Heart rate monitoring</p>

<p>Stuff I do instead
* Focus on good running form, with midfoot strike and high cadence
* Engage the core (I follow the principle of specificity and don&#8217;t do much additional core work)
* Run by feel, particularly rate of perceived exertion</p>

<p>There are a few things that I think might or might not be sound - barefoot running (I do understand the philosophy, but am happy just aiming towards forefoot strike), paleo diet (it might work, but I&#8217;m not convinced that people don&#8217;t just lose weight because of the strictness of the regime).</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to move up to ultra distances next season, I&#8217;m definitely considering the London Ultra race, which is barely ultra at 50 km, but is a step upwards from my one and only marathon. Not sure I&#8217;m ready for desert running, but I like the sound of mountain marathons, as well as some of the hillier coastal endurance runs. One step at a time though. But I want to make sure I&#8217;m running right for long distances, hence the focus on form and technique, something that is often neglected in running.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wasn&#8217;t really looking forward to this race. I felt under-prepared (because I was) and had a minor niggle in the form of a tight left outer calf on the last two runs. And my last bike ride was three weeks ago.</p>

<p>However, I had an early night Saturday (I&#8217;d had an early night most of the week as jetlag following my return from Australia to be fair) and was up at 6am. Had breakfast and coffee, finished off the last remaining tasks and cycled off to the event. A remarkably quiet ride later, with none of the usual waits at level crossings, and I was in the park, ready to register. I realised after registering that it wasn&#8217;t even 7.15am, the official opening time.</p>

<p>It was very pretty though
<img src="/images/duathlonstart1.jpg" align="top"> <img src="/images/duathlonstart2.jpg" align="top"></p>

<p>After registering, I racked my bike, and then had around 90 minutes to relax. So I took some more photos, and just sat and chilled out. With thirty minutes to go, I returned to transition, put on the timing chip, and suncream, put on sunglasses and headed to race start. Watched the elite men start, had a quick warm up jog, and then returned to find my fellow racers being herded into the start pens, so joined them. At 9am prompt, Zac Goldsmith started the race and we were underway.</p>

<p>Given my recent form, my race strategy was to take it easy and hang in there until the end. So I aimed for a Rate of Perceived Exertion of 10 out of 20, and to maintain good form, and that was pretty successful - I slowed down going uphill, sped up slightly going downhill, and ran gently on the flat. Plenty of people overtook me, but that was ok, I was just racing myself. As I got past the 5km, my left calf was feeling slightly tight, but as I got past 6km, and the second water stop, disaster struck - I took the water, and realised that as I slowed to drink it, I was blocking people behind me, so moved to the left slightly, and then turned to throw the empty cup in the bin, and then completely missed a tiny little lip between car park and path and tripped over it, sprawling onto my hands and then rolling onto my hip and left calf. For all the pain of completely stacking it, and the accompanying embarrassment, I got up, dusted myself off, and kept running. I quickly realised that although my hands and legs were sore from cuts and grazes, the calf tightness had disappeared completely. The next kilometre downhill was free and easy and I suffered no running problems from my fall, thankfully.</p>

<p>The second lap was much less eventful, same strategy of RPE 10, and that all went fine - I overtook one bloke who had overtaken me on lap one while sounding knackered already but the rest of it is pretty unmemorable. The stats show I went marginally faster, and wasn&#8217;t the 4th slowest on that particular lap.</p>

<iframe width='465' height='548' frameborder='0' src='http://connect.garmin.com:80/activity/embed/48708396'></iframe>


<p>Onto the bike, and here the pain in my hands didn&#8217;t really help matters, but neither did it hinder my performance particularly. Again, my strategy was to maintain a low RPE, and thus hopefully a consistent pace. Also I tried to eat gels regularly, and drink sufficient energy drink and water. Looking at my times, I pretty much succeeded at consistency, but it did get harder. Part of the problem is psychological, I&#8217;ve done plenty of laps around Richmond Park but never more than four in one go before getting bored! Seven was a real stretch!</p>

<p>I found myself treating the laps like a giant interval session, with two intervals (the main Broomfield Hill and then the hill up to Pembroke Lodge) and the rest of the lap the recovery between them to get up them the next time around.</p>

<p>Peta had come to watch me from the start of the bike - I just saw her enter the park at the end of my first lap, and it was good to see her at different points on the course in the following six bike laps. Apparently I spoiled the photos by telling her how many laps I had left too many times. It was good to have that little extra support though.</p>

<iframe width='465' height='548' frameborder='0' src='http://connect.garmin.com:80/activity/embed/48889281'></iframe>


<p>As I got back to transition, I had a really slow transition, as the walk from bike dismount to my rack was so far and I didn&#8217;t feel like running in my bike shoes by this point. After a slow change of clothes, it was back onto the run.</p>

<p>Again, I tried to maintain a consistent RPE, still 10, but that translated to a bit slower - the run lap was only five minutes slower in total though. My watch died after just 7 minutes on this lap, so I really was going on feel! At the halfway point, it was great to see Peta again, and had a quick kiss before heading on my way to the finish. I was only overtaken by one other ultra distance competitor, and I overtook a few myself. On this lap I was 103rd on the run, compared to 157th on the first run lap, so I was obviously doing better consistency-wise than others.</p>

<p>It was great to finish and to collect my medal - I was happy with 5:55 overall, especially my poor preparation. I then collected my bike and headed to Pembroke Lodge to meet up with Peta for coffee and ice cream. The ride from the finish to Pembroke Lodge is only 4km, although I had to do it along the footpath as the road was still closed, but it was utterly exhausted, so rather than cycle home, I walked to the train station with Peta.</p>

<p>From my times, my goals of consistency and injury-free running were well met (although I&#8217;m in more pain today) - there is about a minute difference between lap 1 and lap 7 on the bike, and five minutes between lap 1 and lap 3 on the run.</p>

<p>We took some photos of my scars

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I rode my bike for the first time in four weeks today, did four laps of Richmond Park. I bonked a little on the last lap, but had a gel and a bar and was ok after that. Pretty pleased with my pace, all things considered.</p>

<p>My goal for the London Duathlon is the least ambitious sounding goal I&#8217;ve ever come up with - to finish before the cutoff. However, as the cutoff is quite aggressive (6h30, I think), it&#8217;ll be relatively tight. I think I should be able to do the 77km bike in 3 hours, if I get my nutrition right (plan will be energy drink and water bottles, and then one gel per lap). That does leave 3h30 for the run, which is longer than I&#8217;d aim for, but Richmond Park is a hilly place, and 30km of that could easily take it out of me. And my training plan for the next fortnight will be runs in Australia when I can, and perhaps the odd swim too.</p>

<p>Ah well, it&#8217;s only a B race, and if nothing else it will be an endurance training session for the half marathon four weeks later. Which I really need to prepare for - I have no worries about going the distance, but I&#8217;d really like to hit 1h45, even if only because that&#8217;s what the friend I&#8217;m racing against will be aiming for too!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two weeks after Ironman, I&#8217;ve yet to regain my mojo. I have a long duathlon in early September and a half marathon in early October that I need to be prepared for, but so far I&#8217;ve run three times (admittedly one of those was a fast 5k) and swum once. I haven&#8217;t once got on the bike.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not too bothered, I think it&#8217;s fairly natural, my motivation to train is diminished (especially swimming - I have no races even planned yet in which I need to swim - but it&#8217;s the area that has a lot of gains still to come), but I will get back into it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m starting to think in terms of goals for next year - for example, I&#8217;d like to get towards a 2:30 olympic triathlon, towards a 3:30 marathon, towards a 20 minute 5k, and get under a 30 minute pool 1500m swim. As I&#8217;m 35 this year, I could aim for a 3:15 marathon in the next couple of years and qualify for Boston - I think there&#8217;s more chance of that than qualifying for Hawaii (slowest M35-39 qualifier in Switzerland was 9h24)!</p>

<p>I plan to work on swim and run technique over the next few months, moving towards a more lightweight run shoe, for example (e.g. my new Brooks Green Silence, pictured here - taken on my phone) and will consider more video swim coaching (as well as going to swim group sessions).

<p>Interesting results from my <a href="http://services.datasport.com/2010/tri/ironman/ALFAT.HTM">full Ironman results</a> - I was 386th in the swim, 390th on the bike, and 279th on the run - 346th overall. Guess my bike needs as much work as my swim! Also my first run lap (57 mins was ridiculously fast relative to the other three (all around 70 mins)).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We arrived in Zurich on Thursday evening and didn&#8217;t really do much other than get to the hotel and go to bed. Friday we went to see a bit of Zurich in what turned out to be the pouring rain, before Peta returned to the hotel and I went to register and to the compulsory briefing. Registration was very efficient - took me about 5 minutes, and I then had a brief look around the expo, although the rain (or Swiss Franc prices) didn&#8217;t tempt me to do more than quickly browse. The race briefing was very thorough, and was well worth attending for my first Ironman. In the evening I went on the Nirvana-provided coach tour of the bike route, which didn&#8217;t help my confidence much but did help me realise that the hills were long and that I should take them easy and treat them with respect.</p>

<p>On Saturday we took it easy with a trip to Rapperswil by ferry, a quick pizza lunch and then the ferry trip back, before I took my bike to transition. Again, considering they were photographing every athlete with their bikes for security reasons, this was remarkably quick. I headed back to the hotel and we then went for a meal at the local trattoria, which was great food, although the one waiter was rushed off his feet serving everyone and it all took a little longer than I&#8217;d hoped. Got to bed just after 11, and set my alarm for 04:15!</p>

<p>When the alarm went off I got up, headed down for a couple of bowls of muesli and a coffee, and then went back to the room to pick up my bags and drinks ready for the race. The coach left the hotel at 5am, and headed to the Ibis to pick up the other Nirvana athletes. They were loaded on, some spectators were unloaded to make room, and we set off, arriving at the race site around 05:40. Once at the race site it didn&#8217;t take long to set up my transition area and so I put my wetsuit on and headed to the swim warm up which was supposed to open at 6am, according to the race briefing. It finally opened at 06:15, and after a quick trip to the loos I entered the water, which was beautiful - lovely and warm and clear. I didn&#8217;t swim very far, just enough to feel loose and ready to go.</p>

<p>After the pro start, they let us into the water at 2 minutes to go, but I hadn&#8217;t even got to the start line before the race had started, but I didn&#8217;t mind too much - better a little behind at the back than cramped up in the biff at the front. I found plenty of feet to draft off, I sighted well, and even the buoys weren&#8217;t too much of a fight. Had a couple of very minor knocks, but nothing race affecting. The channel onto the island at the end of lap one was ridiculously narrow and shallow, and I just pulled myself along the bottom using my hands, ran across the island, back in the water for lap 2. Lap two was fine too, other than the end again - this time the other side of the narrow channel, it got very congested and I was stopped at one point. I thought I could stand on the bottom, but it was too deep and this just gave me massive cramp. This caused me to panic a little, but I remembered to bend my foot and keep swimming - creates more drag and I had to thrash a bit, but by the time I was out the water the cramp was gone and I headed to T1.</p>

<p>T1 was ok, except that I forgot to put on my HRM before putting my gel flasks in my pockets - and the flasks fell out when putting the HRM which cost a little time (probably only fifteen seconds really). The main thing was that I was on the bike within 90 minutes, which was pretty much my swim target, so I was happy there.</p>

<p>Bike was a great ride, if it had been one lap rather than two it would have been a very pleasant ride in the country. I was very pleased with my uphill performance, I overtook loads of people going up (most of them on heavy timetrial bikes who then proceeded to get me back on the flat or downhills). Not bad considering my easiest gear refused to engage (not sure if the hanger got bent on the way over or something). The Beast was nowhere near as bad as it had been made out - it was no worse than a slightly longer, but more gentle, Box Hill. Heartbreak Hill wasn&#8217;t too steep either, and I took quite a few people here. I was suffering major stomach cramps at the start of lap two, and I wondered if I could survive until 120km where the next toilet was. However, I made it and after a pit stop I got back on the bike feeling nicely rested, ready for the next 60km. My bike pretty much followed race plan, which was to enjoy the flats and make the most of the downhills and tailwinds. Some people were a bit annoying and were too close to the middle of the road to overtake easily, perhaps I should have passed them earlier.</p>

<p>Finished the bike a little under 6 hours 30, so after around 8 hours, and had hopes for a sub-12 hour result at this point.</p>

<p>Doing a marathon is hard (I speak only from this one experience). I felt after 2km as if I&#8217;d already run 20km, which was a worry. My early pace was strong, and I was still on for a four hour marathon by the end of lap one, although it was close. However, I was suffering from the heat quite badly, and was very thirsty (perhaps I should have drank more on the bike?), so was having to stop at pretty much every aid station. Even the kilometres when I wasn&#8217;t stopping, I had slowed significantly. By the end of lap two my dreams of a sub-12 finish were fading (as I&#8217;d only had these dreams for a few hours it wasn&#8217;t too bad) and I just had to dig in to complete the race. If the aid stations had been less frequent I&#8217;d have had to go to a run-walk strategy, but as it was, I just ran in between them all and walked the stations.</p>

<p>By the third lap my stomach had settled a little too, and as I started counting down kilometres to go, it started to feel better,
until the fourth lap which I managed to almost enjoy (having a blister from wet feet from all the sponges for the last 5km did not help though) - the temperature had cooled too, and I didn&#8217;t need as much energy, so managed to skip a few aid stations. Finishing the run in around 4:20 was not a bad result under the circumstances.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://apps.ipmedia.ch/finishers/ironman-switzerland-2010">see me finish</a> - search for 1465.</p>

<p>Final time was 12 hours 17 minutes. I was very happy to pull that out from the depths of the second run lap.</p>

<p>So, I am now officially an Ironman! It&#8217;s been a great journey over the last eight months to get here, I won&#8217;t be doing it again this year, and probably won&#8217;t do another one abroad next year, but haven&#8217;t ruled out further challenges. Middle distance triathlon is now officially my favourite though, Long distance is loooooong. Thanks to everyone who has supported me or trained with me!</p>

<p>I do believe I have the potential to do much better in future, I think I could shave at least 20 minutes off each of the splits with better technique in the swim, better bike fitness and more endurance for the run, but I am proud of what I have achieved and the training that I have done so far - saying I can do better is just accepting that I still have untapped potential and working to reduce my limiters and build on my strengths (such as being able to endure a 12 hour race) will not be a waste - I am still far off my potential peak.</p>
