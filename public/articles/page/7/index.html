  <div class="entry-content"><p>Cut short a little way, because there was an aquafit session in the pool starting about 25 mins after I arrived, so managed to get 20 mins in.</p>

<p>Did four consecutive lengths twice, mostly maintaining reasonable form and style. I timed the second set, and I think I managed 2:30, but as per usual, I might have misread the clock. I really do need a lap timer.</p>

<p>Swum several other lengths, trying out various paces and techniques, but nothing as formal as drills yet. I have been in contact with SwimForTri, so am waiting to hear back on a quote now.</p>

<p>So now I just need to improve my swimming (and general fitness) so that I can do 1500m swim, 40km bike, and 10km run! 357 days to go to sort that!</p>

Mon: Swim 30 mins

Fri: Swam 30 mins, then 30 mins gym
Sat: went to see some of the London Triathlon
Sun: Ran 50 mins in one go (10km including warm up) - it really rained on this run, which may have cooled me down and actually improved my performance!</p>

<p>So, a pretty successful week!</p>

<p>Goals for this week:<ul><li>Swim Twice.</li><li>Do two lots of 30 mins constant running.</li><li>Do 10-11km long run at the weekend.</li><li>Book a swimming coach.</li></ul>
I might also do some thinking about whether two 30 mins constant running is the best use of two training sessions - maybe an interval session could replace one of them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Starting to feel a bit more streamlined in the water. Managed two consecutive lengths using what I consider to be correct style. Didn&#8217;t bother with any endurance efforts, as I think they just reinforce bad habits. From now on my endurance efforts will be to improve on two consecutive lengths! Had another read of the drills section in a copy of Triathletes&#8217; World, so will start to incorporate some drills into my sessions.</p>

<p>Oh, and must contact normtheshark, to see when he could do 6 sessions at Charing Cross Sports club coaching my swimming.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now I&#8217;m doing 30 mins consecutively!</p>

From now on I&#8217;m going to concentrate on one weekly long run, and leave the other two sessions as easier runs, just focussing on maintaining a reasonable pace that&#8217;ll let me finish a half-marathon. I&#8217;ll start worrying about PBs etc. next year.</p>

<p>I will however investigate what runner plans there are to bridge 8 weeks and half marathon, that can do it in 10 weeks&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After my <a href="http://willdyke.wordpress.com/2008/07/27/remembering-the-bad-runs/">not-so-enjoyable run on Sunday</a>, I was hoping for better. I was obviously keen to improve matters, as I actually got up at 7am so that I could go running before work, which is rare for me!</p>

<p>I did one of my favourite routes, along the south bank from Hammersmith bridge down towards Putney, turning right just before the embankment along the brook, then out through the playing fields (the gate I planned to use to exit was locked, so had to run around the fields to exit just opposite the Wetland Centre. Then along Church Road to the embankment at Barnes, before heading back along the river back to Hammersmith bridge.</p>

<p>This is now week 7, so 2 sets of 15 mins running, 1 min walking. After my previous <a href="http://willdyke.wordpress.com/2008/07/27/heart-rate-monitor-failure/">issue with my HRM</a>, I had a back up speed based training plan, but I had no issues this time, the HRM worked perfectly. By the end of my run, I was still a way from Hammersmith, so I just decided to just have a third set and run all the way back at a gentle pace. In the end my total running time was 39 mins, and I covered about 7.2km in that time (plus another 800m in warm up).</p>

<p>Anyway, the running felt great, my only problem was keeping in Zone 2 on the HRM (still struggling to work out exactly what my zones should be - I suspect Ful-on tri&#8217;s <a href="http://www.fulontri.com/hrc.htm">heart rate calculator</a> is designed for someone fitter than me!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Approximately 8 or so individual lengths focussing on breathing. Followed by 8 consecutive lengths, in a time of 5:30 (poor - I read <a href="http://www.netlag.com/amy/LP2008/index.html">an Ironman race report</a> today where the woman did the 2.4 miles (3.9km) swim in 1:58/100m - so basically she swam 18.5 times further at a significantly faster speed). I still suck at swimming! I then did a couple of lengths focussing on breathing again, before calling it an evening.</p>

<p>Ah well, it&#8217;s still exercise, but I do need to start properly looking at coaching! However, my sports club has <a href="http://www.ccsclub.co.uk/triathlon.html">Triathlon nights</a> on Tuesdays, which might be worth a look (if only for them to say &#8216;get out of our pool and get some coaching before coming back!&#8217;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Pool was really busy today, so had to navigate between people. As a result I just did about 10 lengths with gaps in between each, focussing on my breathing.</p>

<p>Once a couple of people left, I had a &#8216;lane&#8217; to myself, so did 8 lengths consecutively. I tried to time myself using the wall clock, but either I did 200m in about 5m30 (real slow, but a possibility) or I misjudged where the minute hand was when I started!</p>

<p>I definitely don&#8217;t need a nose clip (I often breathe out through my nose underwater), but perhaps I do need a swimming laptimer<del datetime="00">/HRM (e.g the <a href="http://www.sailgb.com/p/polar_fs1__fitness_heart_rate_monitor_watch/">Polar FS1</a>).</del>. Edit: The FS1 needs a chest strap, which can&#8217;t communicate wirelessly in the water. I&#8217;ll settle for a laptimer/lapcounter like one of the <a href="http://www.activeplanet.co.uk/scindex.php">SportCount</a> models.</p>

<p>Felt pretty tired in the arms and legs afterwards, which I assume means I did some good exercise. Just need to do some good swimming now!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some days aren&#8217;t so successful. I was hoping to have a lovely last week 6 run (3 * 12r1w) before entering week 7 (2 * 15r1w). Unfortunately, it was a bit of a disaster. My warm up and stretching went fine, but as I left the park to head the river, things started to go awry. My Forerunner kept telling me my heart rate was too low for too long - when I looked at what it thought it was, I knew the problem was with the monitoring, not my running.</p>

<p>Today is also a warm, humid day, with little wind, so it&#8217;s quite nice by the river, and in the shade in the park, but it&#8217;s quite easy to get too hot.</p>

<p>I managed the first 12min run ok, but I suspect I was going too fast for the heat, as I quickly flagged by about a third of the way through the second 12 mins. I was feeling quite dehydrated, so wandered to find a shop where I bought and drank a 500ml Lucozade Sport. I figured after that I could carry on for a bit, but unfortunately my watch had given up on my training by then, so couldn&#8217;t just pick up the schedule. So I ran for a while, walked for a minute, ran for another few minutes then decided to call it a day.</p>

<p>I would say I did 12r 1w 4r 15w 8r 1w 6r 20w. I still did 9km, just not much of it at any great speed!</p>

<p>Lessons to learn:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Don&#8217;t go running at 2pm on a hot day</li>
    <li>Eat enough before running</li>
    <li>Find out what is wrong with the HRM</li>
    <li>Learn to pace when the HRM doesn&#8217;t work!</li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;ll crack on with week 7, I don&#8217;t think my problems today indicate I&#8217;m having any particular issues with the training schedule, just problems with heat and my self-pacing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, as mentioned, I had problems with the Heart Rate Monitor on my Garmin Forerunner 405. Given that I&#8217;ve had no issues with the HRM in the past 6 weeks or so since I got the Forerunner, I have three possible theories:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Firmware upgrade from 2.10 to 2.20</li>
    <li>Low battery on a 6 week old HRM</li>
    <li>It was hot and humid today, so I sweated more than normal</li>
</ul>


<p>My understanding is that sweat is good for HRM connectivity, although I could be wrong. Still, I&#8217;ve posted this to the Runner&#8217;s World <a href="http://www.runnersworld.co.uk/forum/forummessages.asp?chklast=1&amp;URN=5&amp;UTN=97268&amp;source=forumnot&amp;#363562">forum</a> to see if anyone has any answers</p>

<p><b>Update: 30/07/2008</b>: I ran at 7am yesterday, and had no problems. From the list of possible causes above, the only thing that differed was the heat and humidity - I sweated less. I can only conclude from this that the cause was almost certainly the heat in one way or another!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Managed two sets of six lengths each swimming in my own way, plus a few lengths up and down while breathing out underwater, trying to concentrate on technique. It&#8217;s the maintaining reasonable style while managing breathing at the same time that I struggle with.</p>

<p>Technique still needs work, endurance is getting there, more practice and then some coaching should do it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I decided to see whether my knee was just stiffening up or anything more serious. This test was by going for my current training run (3 sets of 12 mins running, 1 min walking).</p>

<p>The good news - I got around, and hardly noticed my knee. Except during the walking bits! I certainly felt it when walking home from my run, but after coming home, doing my stretches, taking a warm shower, it doesn&#8217;t feel any worse than it did before.</p>

<p>Not quite sure whether to carry on like this, and do some strength training to protect the knee, or to go see a sports physio, or even a gait analyst. My shoes do have a funny wear pattern (just one side of the heel).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I still don&#8217;t seem to *like* swimming that much! I am improving, however, I managed possibly 5 lengths in one go, but definitely two sets of at least 4 lengths! I am trying to improve my stroke technique, my breathing, and my kicking, although rarely managing all three at the same time! </p>


<p>I think it&#8217;s the breathing that I&#8217;m struggling with most, and the pacing - I seem to start off flailing like a windmill, knacker myself out, move my arms more slowly as a result and then be swimming more efficiently and easily. I should remember to start like that!</p>


<p>My second set of 4x25m was done in 2m35. I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s damn slow!</p>


<p>I know my positioning isn&#8217;t great because I&#8217;m still struggling with exhaling underwater, so my head tends to be above water far more than it should be. However, I will persevere, and I will get better!</p>


<p>Things to consider:<br />
Swimming lessons!<br />
Nose clip?<br />
Paddles? Fins? Floats? (I think they&#8217;d be useful for drills *after* the lessons!)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had some issues with my knee feeling stiff while playing badminton, and have noticed that it can get a bit sore after longer runs, particularly on pavement. However, I&#8217;d been managing that by trying to minimise time on concrete, and stretching before and after a run.</p>

<p>What I didn&#8217;t realise was that walking 5 odd miles from Battersea Power Station to Putney along the river in my walking boots would make my knee stiffer than ever, and because I didn&#8217;t realise, I didn&#8217;t stretch afterwards.</p>

<p>Upshot is, rest from running for the next couple of days, and into the pool. I could go out on my new bike, but I need shoes and cleats etc. first.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My second go at swimming this week. Some progress was made - I swam for a bit with my face in the water, breathing out underwater, and turning my head to breathe in. Occasionally I got the timing of this wrong and inhaled water. This had the side effect of making me keep my head above water, which is bad form! I also tried to remember to push my arms into the water at an angle, rather than flop them in at the end of a windmill cycle. I may have forgotten to kick in all of this. Too many things to remember at once.</p>


<p>Ah well, I managed three consecutive lengths, twice, and several double lengths, and some singles. I also tried to sink to the bottom of the pool, but am too buoyant. I suspect breathing out might help, but then I want to breathe in, and then I might drown!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am a total novice to triathlon. While I&#8217;ve run in the past, and cycled in the past, and even swum in the past, I certainly currently lack the endurance to do all three in one go. </p>


<p><b>Swim</b><br />
My weakest discipline. I currently struggle to do a length. I went swimming in the pool today for the first time in many years. I managed several lengths. None consecutively.</p>


<p><b>Bike</b><br />
I can manage a few miles on a bike. I need to work on high cadence - my school of thought until recently was that you should go in the highest gear you could - this really isn&#8217;t good strategy for endurance!</p>


<p><b>Run</b><br />
I&#8217;ve just finished Week 5 of the <a href="http://www.runnersworld.co.uk/news/article.asp?UAN=30">Runner&#8217;s World Beginners Plan</a>. So I&#8217;m managing to do 24 minutes running in 30. My last run was a worry, as I managed to do 5km exactly in 30 mins. </p>


<p>I&#8217;ve entered the <a href="http://www.royalparkshalf.com/">Royal Parks Half Marathon</a> on October 12. I&#8217;d love to do it in under 2 hours. However, that is predicted by a 26 min 5K, so there&#8217;s some work to do.</p>
