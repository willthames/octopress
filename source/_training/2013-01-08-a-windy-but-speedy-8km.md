A breezy out and back - the first km was encouraging in 5:00 exactly, and
managed to maintain a similar pace even going into the wind until the fifth
km, the last before the second turnaround, where I went 5:03. However, with
the wind on my tail I was able to do much faster speeds for the last three kms.
