  <div class="entry-content"><p>I fancied a change of pace recently and signed up for the 14km City 2 South
race - it&#8217;s quite new but well received last year, and not too pricey with
the easily found online discount (got my last minute entry down to the early
bird price).</p>

<p>I hadn&#8217;t really specifically trained for it (I got chatting to a sales
assistant at the race expo, who asked me if I&#8217;d been training, and what
was the furthest I&#8217;d run - I think my honest replies convinced her I
was ready for it!) but except for the Tuesday before the race, which was
two days after my Camp Mountain marathon, when my quads were still shot, I
felt I was running well enough.</p>

<p>In terms of goals, I had Twilight Half Marathon and last year&#8217;s Bridge to
Brisbane to set expectations - I knew I wasn&#8217;t 100% fit for B2B so figured
I should theoretically do around the same pace - 4:30/km and be able to do
quicker than Twilight which was 4:45/km. So I was thinking 63 minutes would
be a good target, and even getting under 70 wouldn&#8217;t be too embarrassing
as I really wasn&#8217;t sure whether I was ready for fast efforts following
The North Face and the accompanying cold.</p>

<p>I got to the race in good time - about half an hour before the start, which
meant I could get right to the start of my wave, which was the second to
leave. The first wave left at 7am, and we left at 7:05. I was a bit worried
about congestion so I made sure I kept near the front of the wave without
going out too hard. Once I was a km in I made sure my breathing felt right
and concentrated on settling in to a sustainable rhythm.</p>

<p>The first 11km or so is relatively flat with the odd lump here and there,
which kept it interesting, I concentrated on not &#8220;burning too many matches&#8221;,
to use Matt Fitzgerald&#8217;s metaphor from
<a href="http://www.velopress.com/books/iron-war/">Iron War</a>,
and trying to keep a consistent level of effort.</p>

<p>Around UQ I seemed to catch up with the back of the red wave, so it got a bit
annoying for the next couple of kms with lots of weaving around people. But
I was still running well and happy, but with the knowledge that I needed
to save myself for the last 3km too.</p>

<p>Once back across the river, the climb started from Dutton Park to the top
of Highgate Hill. All the trail running training really helped here as I
was able to pass quite a lot of people, and was 149th fastest for the uphill
section.
Unfortunately I wasn&#8217;t able to capitalise as well on the downhill section,
where I was 402nd fastest, and lost 17 places.</p>

<p>One flaw in my race execution was that my watch was saying 13.7km at the end,
so I hadn&#8217;t realised how little I had left to do - I was saving myself for
the last 300m that didn&#8217;t exist.</p>

<p>Over the line in 1:00:10, 279th out of 3827, an average pace of 04:23/km.
According to <a href="http://www.mcmillanrunning.com/index.php/calcUsage/calculate">McMillan&#8217;s running calculator</a>, extrapolating that to a 15km
time of 1:05, that time predicts a 3:17 marathon and a 1:33 half. Both of
which would be massive PBs.</p>

<p>My training regime has not been at all focused since The North Face, and
other than hill training, very little of my training would have had much
impact on speed.</p>

<p>Two things that are worth bearing in mind - 10 hour training weeks leads
to weight loss without much thinking about diet - and I haven&#8217;t really gained
much weight in the last month. And the weather is perfect for running at the
moment - it&#8217;s a little chilly in the mornings and evenings. Tonight, the
day after the race, I did a 53 minute 11km, which is much faster than I
usually manage. But with a cool evening temperature, there&#8217;s no need to
stop for water, breathing is easy, and sub 5:00/km is comfortable for me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be having a week off running from Friday - I&#8217;m not taking my running kit
away for our wedding anniversary. Wednesday will be the usual trail run, and
I might do some Kangaroo Point steps on Thursday to maintain an edge.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m loving running right now, so many things I want to achieve. But that will
be a separate post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This post is quite long, worthy of the race it reports.
Grab a cup of tea, sit down, and read on&hellip;
Mostly written on Tuesday and finished off with pictures on Sunday.</p>

<h2>Race report</h2>

<p>After my <a href="/article/2014/05/14/with-three-days-to-go-dot-dot-dot/">inauspicious lead-up</a> to the race, I continued the non-training bits of race preparation as
best I could, sorting out my energy drink sachets so that I had 16 bags with 50g
each (thankfully I didn&#8217;t have to explain the baggies of white powder at airport security),
packing my race kit and supporting my support crew.</p>

<p>This was my first race where Peta was supporting in a participatory sense,
doing more than cheering (or writing encouraging messages in chalk on the Ironman
run in Zurich!). I wasn&#8217;t totally sure what I would need, but wrote some
checklists for each checkpoint including location, estimated time of arrival
and what things I might need. This allowed me to defer decisions such as
whether I&#8217;d need a change of shoes at checkpoint 4 or 5 (or, as it turns out,
at all). I could also give Peta a funnel to fill my bottles with powder, and
carry warm clothes for later, and give me the food I&#8217;d prepared. All in all the
checklists were pretty successful.</p>

<p>Also in the build up to the race, I found the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Unofficial-North-Face-100-Training/">Unofficial North Face 100 Training</a> page
on Facebook, which led me to a <a href="http://run.dj">great blog including preparation tips</a> including the checklists idea.</p>

<p>I still wasn&#8217;t feeling 100% better on the Friday, and I found the slight incline
from the parking to registration at the race start really affected my breathing.
However, it was also very cold, and I was suffering a little from pre-race nerves.</p>

<p>Race registration, for me, in 2014, was amazingly efficient. I got to registration at 7pm
and by 7:02 I was registered and by 7:04 I had the goodie bag. Unfortunately
I then had to stick around another 30 minutes until compulsory race briefing
which started late and ran long. I should have grabbed a seat before it started
as my legs were sore during the night following an hour standing. I would
complain more but the Welcome from the traditional owners was very moving and
I wouldn&#8217;t have missed that for anything. The lovely elderly woman who thanked
us for coming and loving the land was truly touching (and perhaps more generous
than deserved given the amount of race litter I saw, only some of which I had
the energy to pick up and take out with me).</p>

<p>After registration I went home, we finished cooking dinner, ate, and once I felt that
everything that needed to be done was done, I went to bed. I slept well for the
first half and then I got hot and my leg was very painful &mdash; I was half convinced
I might have deep vein thrombosis or something &mdash; but whatever it was,
I never felt it after I started running.</p>

<p>Parking at the start wasn&#8217;t great, but we didn&#8217;t have to park too far away,
and got to the start in plenty of time. Although I miscounted the wave starts
and thought the third was yet to go when mine was 2 minutes from starting &mdash; I
wasn&#8217;t as ready as I&#8217;d have liked at that point, but sorted myself out in time.</p>

<p>There was always a doubt in my mind that I might make no further in the race
than the first 5km, which was an out and back where if I was feeling truly
dreadful still, then would be the time to withdraw. The out and back was pretty
enjoyable for an uphill slog (followed by a downhill slog I suppose) &mdash; we drove
the same route on Tuesday morning and I thought &#8220;Wow, I ran (ok, walked) this&#8221;. Great views, fun
times, lots of early camaraderie.</p>

<p>Back at Scenic World, Peta had picked a great spot to stand &mdash; I could see her
a few hundred metres away and give her a big wave to warn her I was on my way
and to have the camera ready. I stopped for a quick kiss and to let her know I was
feeling good and was running well, which was a nice surprise for me too.</p>

<p>Down the Furber steps we went, the steps taking their toll on my quads, and
then along the Federal Pass, past the landslide (where things got a bit slow
and queuey) and then to the bottom of Golden Steps. These steps were probably
the toughest of the day for me as I&#8217;d yet to learn how to deal with them, but
the answer was to take more breaks, and sooner. My lung capacity due to my cold
was not 100%, and that meant that it was easy to over do it. On all later uphill
stairs, I did stop often and never felt quite so out of breath.</p>

<p>Still, once at the top it was a quick jaunt to the first checkpoint, where I
refilled bottles and camelbak. Signal wasn&#8217;t good enough to send a text to Peta,
which I should have done anyway &mdash; I didn&#8217;t realise until the next checkpoint that
the online tracker never showed me arriving at checkpoint one, and people were
starting to get concerned back home!</p>

<p>I had my one stack of the day where I tripped on some hidden obstacle and went
flying. Thankfully it was mostly sand/dirt road, and I had nothing more than
a graze or two and some wounded pride. A young American woman who I&#8217;d just passed
stopped to make sure I was ok, and then we ran for quite a while chatting
happily, which is always unexpected and pleasant. I let her go on at the 20km
point so I could take a 20km selfie! Shortly after the 20km point we had the
Taros ladders. Chatting to another American lady later, if you were in a later
wave the queues were bad and the detour was horrific, so I was very pleased
to get to the ladders with only a few people in the queue &mdash; it was perfectly
fine for me, the benefits of getting a good starting wave.</p>

<p><a class="fancybox" rel="20km" href="/images/tnf100_selfie_20km.jpg">
  <img class="img-thumbnail" src="/images/thumbs/tnf100_selfie_20km.jpg" alt="" title="20km and beautiful surrounds"></a>
<a class="fancybox" rel="20km" href="/images/tnf100_pro_cresting_the_hill.jpg">
  <img class="img-thumbnail" src="/images/thumbs/tnf100_pro_cresting_the_hill.jpg" alt="" title="Cresting the hill (Aurora)"></a></p>

<p>From Taros to Checkpoint 2 seems utterly unmemorable now &mdash; there were lots
of steps down where I felt uneasy, and very worried about later steps if I
felt that wobbly there, but it turns out I recovered fine later on &mdash; I was
probably still feeling Furber steps!</p>

<p>At Checkpoint 2 I let Peta know I was doing fine (in fact I was pretty much
bang on ETA) refilled everything I needed to refill, ready for the next 15km
stage. The route to Checkpoint 3 was much more memorable. The hike up to
Ironpot ridge looked horribly steep, but wasn&#8217;t actually as bad as it looked &mdash;
Chainsaw on Camp Mountain is the same steepness, but the path is straight up
it, whereas this path zigzagged. Along Ironpot Ridge we came across King David
who&#8217;d given us the welcome the night before, playing his clack sticks, with
some friends playing the didgeredoo, and they were very friendly and
encouraging (only 65km to go! &mdash; yeah, thanks!). The run down from Ironpot
ridge was probably the worst section of the race for me &mdash; completely did my
knees in and might have contributed to how bad I felt for the last 20km. It
was basically a steep and dusty downhill, very tough on the legs.</p>

<p>After the joys of Ironpot ridge, we had the fun of the rise up to Checkpoint 3.
This was a hill that rose for 5km. I wasn&#8217;t convinced I was actually going to
run any of the last half of this leg at all, but after that long 5km it
flattened off and then went downhill, so I actually managed some quickish
kms (it was also the middle of the day so there was a little bit of run/walk
too, not to mention stops to get crap out of my shoe!) to get to Checkpoint 3.
The gear check was a little bit of a faff, as I had to get my fleece out of my
stuff sack, but I totally understand the point of it, so I just treated it like
a mandatory rest!</p>

<p>I had written instructions for Peta at Checkpoint 3, but only to be used if
I was running at least two hours late &mdash; in the end I was bang on time.
This was to save her the hassle of in my mind an unnecessary burden &mdash; it was
only 11km to the next checkpoint with an expected time for the leg of two hours.
I&#8217;m still very happy with this decision &mdash; it probably gave Peta more than two
hours back of her day and I was still feeling great at this point. I knew any
leg that was suggested as taking 2 hours for 11km wasn&#8217;t going to be easy, but
then again, not much of the course is!</p>

<p>Onwards to Checkpoint 4 along the Six Foot Track, and here I met what turned
out to be a great race friend, who saw me trying ineptly to take a 50km selfie
and said &#8216;if you wait 30 seconds, I&#8217;ll take it for you&#8217;, and did so. After that
we ran together for quite a bit, and also bumped into another of his running
club mates, Erika, who was also very kind &mdash; she heard me coughing and offered
me her inhaler &mdash; she took the offer back when I told her it was my cold, but
it was really nice of her. Both Peter and Erika really helped me mentally get
up Nellies Glen, which is the step-filled trudge back up from the valley to
Katoomba. I saw Peter quite often for the rest of the race, until he went flying
past me on the descent from Kedumba around the 85km mark &mdash; he finished half an
hour before me in the end, which given his performance on uphill and downhill
(I was quicker on the flat, which was no help for the last 20km!) was deserved.</p>

<p>After Nellies Glen, it wasn&#8217;t too far to get to Checkpoint 4 &mdash; Peta was again
well placed to spot me, and she saw me before I saw her for some more photos.
Unfortunately neither of us knew that she&#8217;d have to take a very long route into
the sports centre to be able to support me, but in the end it just meant I had
a couple of minutes extra rest &mdash; and I was out again in 10 minutes or so, much
quicker than the two people who left at the same time as me and started talking
about their 25 minute luxury stop! Together Peta and I sorted out filling bottles,
feeding me, checking off the checklist. My new running friend Peter had given
me a top tip, which was to try and get down Giant Stairway before dark. So I
didn&#8217;t hang around &mdash; Peta and I got a bit confused when she said &#8216;See you at 5&#8217;
(meaning the checkpoint) and I said &#8216;that&#8217;s only an hour, I&#8217;m going to take
four!&#8217; but we quickly worked that out!</p>

<p>The next stage of the run was the bit of the North Face 50 from last year
that I&#8217;d really struggled with. I was convinced the race director was a
sadist and put as many stairs into the section as possible. This year, my
frame of mind was very different &mdash; I&#8217;d trained for stairs, I accepted it as
very much a key part of the North Face race, and was ready for it. And I felt
happier and easier doing the stairs this year than last year, even though I&#8217;d
run 20km further at that point. Sure, I forgot about blocks of stairs but
I never found myself particularly annoyed by them.</p>

<p>At some point on the stairs, we came across a cockatoo, just standing on a step.
I said &#8220;Hello Cocky!&#8221;, to which he/she replied &#8220;Hello!&#8221;. So of course I had to
say hello again. Presumably it&#8217;d either escaped from a family or had just learned
to say hello on the trails, but it wasn&#8217;t at all bothered by all these trail runners
going past!</p>

<p>It was great to stop
at the 66km water stop, where I was well looked after by Steph, a three year
old, who helped fill my camelbak (with the help of her mum).</p>

<p>After a couple more kms, I was convinced I must have passed the Fairmont and
was ahead of schedule, so I texted Peta to let her know this crucial fact.
Ten minutes later, I realised we&#8217;d just reached Sublime Point Road, and I
was probably about on time, so I texted Peta to cancel the crucial fact. I&#8217;d
likely have been more on time for the checkpoint if I hadn&#8217;t spent all that time
texting! Still, I made the best of the steps down from the Fairmont, and it
seemed to be a long and wiggly and windy path to Wentworth Falls, but I got there
in the end, and crossed the falls for what I expected to be a long and lengthy
climb back up to Kings Tableland, but it was nowhere near as bad as I expected,
and it was all relatively straightforward. I walked with Peter while the path
still tracked uphill, but once we got onto the roads, and it started going
downhill, I set off, determined to be as on time as I could &mdash; it was a run/walk
combo, but I was still definitely running at times!</p>

<p>Checkpoint 5 was a bit of a nightmare &mdash; I messed up filling one of my bottles,
and filled it with energy drink rather than water. I also needed to pick up
my mandatory fleece. I decided to change my top in case I got cold too. I
did get cold for a few minutes in the next section but I&#8217;d have been better off
keeping my original short sleeved top as I was too hot at times in the next
section, and only ever slightly cold briefly. Amazingly the breezes coming out
of the valley were warmer than the rest of the air (we&#8217;d been warned to expect
cold breezes, which seems a sensible warning most of the time!)</p>

<p>And then almost 10km downhill. In 2013, that 10km took me about 50 minutes. This
year I was a lot slower &mdash; about 90 minutes, because I was no longer comfortably
able to run downhill &mdash; my knees and my quads were just not willing to suffer
in silence. I was actually happier going uphill &mdash; it was slower, of course,
but I felt like I was making as good progress this year as last year.</p>

<p>The distance between the 90km marker and the supposed 91km water point seemed
enormous but at that point everything was a walk, uphill, and thus taking nearly
15 minutes to do a kilometre. I could hear people around me complain about the
length of the hill, but I was at peace with it &mdash; it was a long trudge but
I preferred it to the succeeding flatter section. After the climb came the
clearing, and then upwards again to Federal Pass, which felt pretty comfortable.
The run through Leura Forest felt fine but I really slowed further for the last
5kms &mdash; I was stuck behind some people but really didn&#8217;t have anything left in
my legs to want to overtake.</p>

<p>Finally I got to the Furber Steps and tried to text Peta. But no signal. So I
proceeded up the steps, and then tried again. No luck. A bit further, I tried
again &mdash; still no signal. Higher up, I received a text from Peta, so I stopped
and tried again. In the end, I got to pretty much the top and called Peta to
warn her I was on the home stretch. So, top tip for any TNF 100k-ers &mdash; make
better arrangements to meet at the finish. I&#8217;m not sure what else I could have
done, because I was much slower over the last 5km than I expected, but at least
I might have known not to bother trying any earlier. Still, I needed some rest
stops on the way up, but probably not quite that many.</p>

<p>And then I was walking up the boardwalk to Scenic World, and saw a sign saying
last 5 steps, and so started running &mdash; I bounded up the steps, and then finished
strong nearly across the line, pausing slightly to let Peta take a photo, and
then crossed into her arms. After some uncertainty about what happens next,
I went to collect my medal, and bumped into Peter on his way out, so it was
great to find out how he&#8217;d done. I then had the best chicken soup I&#8217;d ever had
(another top tip &mdash; have chicken soup as a meal &mdash; the meal I prepared myself
was very stodgy and unappealing). Peta then drove me home, ran me a jacuzzi
and opened the bottle of fizz that we had in the fridge, and all was good with
the world. I also took the opportunity while the jacuzzi was being run to catch
up on all the vast amount of good wishes that people had left on Facebook, it
was lovely to feel so well supported.</p>

<p>100kms in 17:51, about 40 minutes slower than the first four checkpoints
suggested I should manage, and certainly I did feel like the wheels fell off
a little in the final stage (although I actually picked up 8 places),
but well within the 20 hour cutoff for bronze
buckle, and significantly under the 28 hour cutoff for the race. I earned my
4th wave start position (45-60th percentile) with last years North Face 50,
and I believe I justified it with this year&#8217;s North Face 100 (456th out of
over 1000 entrants &mdash; I don&#8217;t know yet how many actually started)</p>

<h2>Kit</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bamboo technical top (Royal Parks Half 2010 finishers top &mdash; my most visible top
for Peta&#8217;s benefit) until CP5</li>
<li>Gore Running long sleeve with mitten cuffs &mdash; good for the first 2km when
I was cold and my hands were wet after the checkpoint, too hot afterwards. Should
have just worn running gloves for a couple of ks.</li>
<li>Ronhill shorts with just a little inside flap as a pocket &mdash; didn&#8217;t think I needed
pockets given my backpack but they&#8217;d have been good to keep e.g. gloves in.</li>
<li>Salomon Crossmax shoes &mdash; probably one of their last runs &mdash; they&#8217;ve done over
500km since I started tracking my shoes at the start of the year, it&#8217;s probably
nearer 1000km in their lifetime. And even Peta thinks they look like they need
replacing.</li>
<li>Salomon S-Lab 12. Gets rave reviews, barely moves on the body, has excellent
front pockets for bottles. But has wire reinforcement that really digs in, and
a stupid front securing mechanism needing to connect or disconnect 4 different
clasps everytime you want to take it off or put it on. And while it is 12L, some
of that only works if you put everything in a stuff sack, which is awkward for
gear checks. I think I&#8217;ll be replacing it and hoping for a good price on ebay
(I hope noone reads this before buying it!)</li>
<li>X-Socks marathon. Great, although perhaps a little short for this event as
grit got in too easily &mdash; but so so comfortable on the feet.</li>
<li>Neutrogena Beach Defense spray on sun protection. Allows me to sweat with it
on, which beats most sun cream.</li>
<li>Skin slather lube. I had no chafing where I used this, and it quickly resolved
where I missed using it.</li>
<li>I was pleased with my nutrition/hydration choice. I&#8217;m not at all affiliated
with <a href="http://tailwindnutrition.com.au/">Tailwind Nutrition</a>, but their
product works for me &mdash; I had something like thirteen out of the sixteen planned
pouches. I did get a bit peckish around the 70km mark, and had a Boost. I also
had a little of my sausage and potato food, but really not very much. It was
easier to keep on top of the required amount of Tailwind when it was warmer &mdash;
probably the 70km flagging was because I had only drank half the amount I should
have from the 56km checkpoint. But I think chicken soup at Checkpoints 4 and 5
would have gone down well.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Post race thoughts</h2>

<p>I don&#8217;t feel the need to do that particular 100km again, although I&#8217;ll never say
never. If I thought I could get a silver buckle to go with my new bronze buckle,
I might, but shaving nearly four hours off my time seems near impossible. There
are so many great races to do that would be difficult to do in the same year
that I also want to do &mdash; Tarawera and Cradle Mountain being two off the top of
my head. And I&#8217;d also like to try some of the other Blue Mountain races, such
as Mount Solitary or the Six Foot Track.</p>

<p>On North Face 100 preparation, aside from my cold, which may well have been
a blessing in that I was definitely well rested and couldn&#8217;t go too hard early
on (I felt much better later in the day, perhaps after I&#8217;d cleared myself out),
there are some things I&#8217;d suggest. Very steep downhill training (I can only
think Chainsaw) but that has its own risks &mdash; either of falling or just damaging
knees in the practice. More step <em>walking</em>. I did plenty of stair running
(it&#8217;s probably impossible to do too much but I felt I did enough) but
specifically downstairs walking, preferably with unevenness. Also more downhill
running training &mdash; the 10km from Queen Victoria Hospital to Jamison Creek could
have felt easier.</p>

<p>Other race top tips. Wear gaiters. The amount of time I spent getting crap out
of my shoes was probably getting towards 10 minutes. And grit got in the top of
my socks and rubbed the tops of my feet such that I&#8217;m wearing blister plasters
there now.</p>

<p>Peta and I worked out the support strategy quite well for a first time.
Having spare bottles and camelbak would have meant we could just do bottle swaps
rather than me having to fill them (supporters weren&#8217;t allowed near the water).
And the 99km texting was a lesson hard learned, that I should have realised
given the paucity of the GPS signal down there, but no regrets.</p>

<p>Unlike in the 50 last year, where I swore to give up trail running, this year
I felt happy and confident the whole way through. I never felt like I would
need to give up (although how difficult I found the first stair climb gave
me some cause for concern, and my legs felt a bit shaky on some of the technical
downhills around the Taros steps, and I worried that they&#8217;d feel worse later, but
neither worry was serious nor, in hindsight, warranted!). I don&#8217;t recall many
races where I felt so capable!</p>

<h2> Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>Thanks to Peta for providing the middle ground of being suitably cautious
about my crazy ideas, but going along for the ride once convinced. Her
support on the day and indeed the days afterwards has been invaluable. We&#8217;re
going to have many more adventures together, and more holidays in the Blue
Mountains where I can actually do some decent walking with her!</p>

<p>I would like to thank the traditional owners of the area for their heartfelt
welcome and the work they do to conserve the land for generations to come.</p>

<p>The organisation of the 2014 North Face seemed even better than usual (I think
the change of venue helped them) &mdash; it was well marked, everything was smooth
(except perhaps the direction at the finish, but when I did ask what to do next,
they were very helpful). I think Tom and Alina and everyone involved do a
fantastic job. I&#8217;d like to particularly thank everyone who volunteered their time
as marshals, at checkpoints, and start and finish.</p>

<p>My new friends I made on the race &mdash; I&#8217;ll probably never meet them again but
Peter and Erika from Sydney Striders, Charlene who made sure I was ok after
my fall, Ariane who helped me sort my light out and the other people
with whom I walked the slow
climb from Leura Valley, whose names I never knew, it was still great!</p>

<p>The Bunyaville Trail Runners have been a great set of training buddies &mdash; so
thanks to Grant for doing a great job organising it, and to everyone on the
weekly runs, plus particular thanks to everyone who&#8217;s gone on a long training
run with me &mdash; Aaron, Paul, Brad, Stuart. Oh, and a big thanks to Shayne for
his valuable mantra &#8216;Trust in your training&#8217; which spoken by him sounds like
an instruction from a Jedi Master.</p>

<p>This year most of my social running has been with my trail buddies, and I&#8217;ve
had to neglect my parkrun friends to concentrate on longer things (and avoid
the risk of injury from short sharp runs!). I&#8217;m looking forward to going back
and seeing everyone, and I&#8217;d like to thank Brendan Smith, a fellow endurance
runner who&#8217;s just come back from doing two marathons in China (including a
ten hour effort on the Great Wall &mdash; lest anyone think he&#8217;s a slacker, the
winner did it in six!) who said &#8216;Bragging rights are forever&#8217;, another helpful
mantra for my run, and much more positive than drug cheat
Armstrong&#8217;s &#8216;Quitting is forever&#8217;.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who liked or commented on Peta&#8217;s updates on Facebook &mdash;
the tracking that Peta did was more up to date and accurate than the official
timings, and she was able to let me know how much everyone was cheering me on.
And I did really enjoy catching up on it all after the race, so thank you all!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My last run was now a week ago &mdash; a good variation on the usual routes
at Bunyaville. My plan for Thursday was to have another go at the Kangaroo
Point steps, and then 20km at the weekend for a casual 50km for the week.</p>

<p>I started getting more and more snuffly around lunch time on Thursday and
when I coughed, it was pretty chesty. I very nearly went running in the
afternoon but thought it best to leave it.</p>

<p>On Friday I still wasn&#8217;t terrible, but I was getting worse, and
Saturday and
Sunday were very coughy and raspy. Anyway, long story short, the cold itself
seemed to properly kick in on Monday with the full on sneezing and sniffles
and general bunged up ness. The cough hasn&#8217;t fully gone away,
certainly not enough to want to risk running at this point.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t been to work all week &mdash; by this point not because I feel too unwell to work,
but because I am too unwell to be in an office spreading my germs to everyone
else.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m hoping to squeeze in some kind of run, no matter how short, in the next
day or two, but I&#8217;m erring on the side of caution &mdash; I&#8217;d rather have ten days
off running if it means that I&#8217;m ok to run on Saturday.</p>

<p>There are some positive things to take from this. I&#8217;m not injured, just ill.
It&#8217;s presumably just a cold, so I should recover soon.
Emil Zatopek <a href="http://www.joefrielsblog.com/2010/04/history-lesson-the-zatopek-effect.html">discovered the benefits of tapering</a>
through a period just like
this, and significantly beat everyone else in his race. So I could totally
win the North Face 100 as a result of this downtime.</p>

<p>I do have to take care of my body &mdash; I&#8217;m very hopeful that I&#8217;ll be
on the start line on Saturday morning, but I&#8217;m trying to avoid the risk of
bronchitis or pneumonia for a race, so I&#8217;ll be making the decision to
race carefully. Either way I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have
a wonderful time in the Blue Mountains.</p>

<time datetime="2014-05-01T19:05:00+10:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 1<span>st</span>, 2014</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>April was a productive month in running terms, with lots of events specific
to training for The North Face 100.</p>

<p>In my <a href="/article/2013/06/01/fantasy-north-face-100km/">Fantasy North Face</a> post,
I mention a few key things I thought I needed to do to be 100km ready. One of
those was normalising the distance. With that in mind I did
<a href="/article/2014/04/07/race-report-nerang-50km/">Nerang 50km</a> as a
fantastic race tune-up run, with no specific preparation &mdash; I signed up on the
Wednesday and did it on the Sunday.</p>

<p>I also mentioned hill training, which is what I was doing two weeks later when
I ran a <a href="/article/2014/04/20/ninth-times-a-charm-a-marathon-on-camp-mountain/">marathon around Camp Mountain</a> &mdash; which
was a 42.9km run with 2400m of elevation. That was also a good opportunity
to test running with full race kit and test nutrition and hydration strategies.</p>

<p>In between those I did a nice short sharp race at the
<a href="/article/2014/04/13/race-report-pinnacles-2014/">Pinnacles</a> event.</p>

<p>My weekly volume has averaged on the high side &mdash; I&#8217;d planned to do 70km a week &mdash; I
took a short week of just 51km the week after my 50km after Nerang, but the
other weeks beat the target (by 15km in two of the other weeks!). More
importantly for the North Face, I have managed nearly 8000m of ascent
in April. The Pinnacles and Camp Mountain were both events that were
proportional in ascent to the North Face race.</p>

<p>Someone asked me at the weekend if I&#8217;d lost weight (other than the haircut).
I haven&#8217;t been diligently tracking but it&#8217;s probably 5kg since Christmas.
I&#8217;m at my lowest weight since Ironman Zurich &mdash; around the same
weight as just before Challenge Henley. My optimal race weight is probably still
a few kg lighter but that&#8217;d involve sacrificing pizza and beer &mdash; which
would negate the point of running in the first place, for me! So around ten
hours a week of running appears to be sufficient &mdash; slightly more efficient
than 18 hours a week of triathlon training.</p>

<p>All in all, I could feel more ready, but I&#8217;ve been pushing my body to do
what I&#8217;ve felt physically and mentally capable of. Just over two weeks
until the main event! This week will be another 70km week and then I&#8217;ll reduce
volume and probably elevation too so that I stop feeling so bloody tired every
time I run! I probably haven&#8217;t done enough steps (so I&#8217;ll run some more
tomorrow) but at least this year I know what to expect and I&#8217;ve at least
done plenty of uphill and downhill to strengthen the legs.</p>

<p>And I got my mandatory kit signed off, so that&#8217;s one less thing to do at race
registration. Still going to be a busy Friday afternoon given the mandatory
race briefing at 7:30pm plus registration etc.</p>

<p>I also went through the
route for the course, looking at where the specific tough bits are. There are
a few quite nasty looking bits, particularly around half way as we come out of
the valley up into Katoomba. But then I thought
&#8216;that&#8217;s not much worse than a loop of Camp Mountain,
and I did eight of them in a day&#8217;.</p>

<p>April stats:<ul>
<li>Distance: 323km</li>
<li>Ascent: 7918m according to Garmin &mdash; usual disclaimers apply.</li></ul></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was around Monday that I first considered doing the Camp Mountain marathon
on Easter Saturday. We had already planned a family gathering for Saturday lunch
time, but I just needed to make pudding, turn up, eat and drink &mdash; and I could
make the pudding on Good Friday.</p>

<p>I put the word out on Facebook to see if anyone was interested in coming along
or doing a more interesting run - the reason for choosing to do 8 circuits of
Camp Mountain was that it&#8217;s quite a safe trial run - you&#8217;re never really more than
2.5kms away from the car, there are people on it (although not as many as I
thought - I saw one walker, one group of three mountain bikers and one solo
mountain biker!). No-one was up for it but my public statement also makes it
harder not to do it!</p>

<p>One of the objects of doing the run was a backpack trial - this was the first
time I&#8217;ve used my backpack with the full mandatory North Face race kit. I was
pleased to find that excluding water, the kit only weighs 2kg, with water, that
can go up to 5kg - but I don&#8217;t plan to carry more than 2 litres of water at any
time.</p>

<p>After a quick breakfast and coffee, I drove over to Camp Mountain
and got ready to go, setting off on my run at about 5:55am, with the sun
not yet visible behind the hills.</p>

<p>I knew that the day was going to be quite warm - up to 28&deg;C at the hottest
point of the day, and I didn&#8217;t want to blow up, and so my aim was to start
gently and ease into it. Each part of the lap, if I thought I might need
to walk it in 7 laps time, I walked on the first lap. Which meant I pretty
much walked the first 1.2km. At the top I took a photo on my phone with Brisbane
behind (unfortunately my proper camera was out of battery - I hadn&#8217;t charged
it for a while
but it was working the day before - I still lugged it round as practice weight
for the rest of the run), used the facilities and then headed onwards on my
downward journey to the car, where I changed into sunglasses and hat.</p>

<p>The next seven laps were really quite similar - I only took a photo break at
the top of laps 5 and 9 (at the top of 5 I texted Peta with my estimated
time of completion - I actually finished quicker than that as the second
half was slightly quicker than the first). I was able to run pretty much
exactly what I expected to run from the first lap. The hill was surprisingly
variable - laps 5 and 6 for example were nearly a minute quicker than lap 2,
and I have no explanation for it! By laps 7 and 8 the temperature was probably
having an effect, but only on the uphill - the downhill section remained
comfortable. Occasionally I had to stop to get rid of the odd stone or twig
from my shoes.</p>

<a class="fancybox" rel="mountaintop" href="/images/lap9.jpg">

<p>However, as the graph below shows (with a row for each of the 8 laps plus the
last out and back), the laps were relatively consistent - around 12 minutes
for the first km, 8 minutes (unless I stopped at the top) for the second,
six and a bit for the third and fourth km (except laps 6 and 8 where I did
sub six for both). The fifth km is really variable, as it includes the time
taken during any stops at the car to top up my bottles. I was very happy
with this consistency, and indeed that my 8th lap was faster than my 2nd.</p>

<p>One of my concerns about the run was that I would not feel motivated to
continue, but I never felt like stopping at all. By the time I completed
each loop, the long downhill had given me enough recovery time to be
ready to start again.</p>

<p>The club record for this (by the only other person to have attempted it) is
pretty much bang on six hours and I did 6:15. I don&#8217;t know whether I could
go 15 minutes quicker with less weight, or whether I&#8217;ll ever want
to find out!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tomorrow I&#8217;m going for a run with as much of the
<a href="http://www.thenorthface100.com.au/RaceInfo/#MandatoryGear">North Face 100 Mandatory Kit</a>
as I possess (I&#8217;m missing a food bar and the waterproof trousers, and some
of the stuff provided by the event - maps, firelighters etc). This should give
me an insight as to whether I need to tweak my backpack or packing and just give
some good training!</p>

<p>I thought I&#8217;d take a photo of everything I needed, so laid it all out on the
bed. And then Elska, our ragdoll cat, decided to help take stock</p>

<time datetime="2014-04-13T17:22:00+10:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Apr 13<span>th</span>, 2014</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Pinnacles was my first proper trail race back in April 2012. I thought
I might have written up a race report at the time but alas no.</p>

<p>My memories of that run are mostly of thinking myself well out of my depth.
The race entry page had said &#8216;for very fit runners only&#8217; and I&#8217;d thought
well I&#8217;m quite fit, how bad can it be. At about 4km into the 18km race I
thought &#8216;fitter than this&#8217; as I suffered my way to the top of another of the
18 hills and couldn&#8217;t muster the energy to start running down. I was last
in absolute terms (there were 4 waves so difficult to know how I was fairing)
for nearly half the race and I saw the sweeper behind me at one point. It was
only after the halfway checkpoint that I started to enjoy myself and overtake
other runners and finish in 2:09.</p>

<p>This time around it was a little different. Obviously I have two years more
trail experience, and I run on terrain not dissimilar to the Pinnacles nearly
every week. I ran up a lot of the hills I walked up last time, and was always
able to start running again if I had walked once I got to the top.</p>

<p>The first time around I found some of the downhills unrunnable - this time
I just found them barely runnable. And while I did have to walk some of the
steeper uphills, I didn&#8217;t find them particularly long or impossibly steep -
just obstacles to beat.</p>

<p>I ran through the halfway checkpoint this time (saying hi to Grant who was
manning it as I did so), as I had all the liquid I
needed on me (and more - I had a litre of energy drink and a litre of water).
I was able to run well on the long downhill and keep going when it peaks
upwards a bit a couple of times towards the finish. I passed a couple of
running friends on the way in, and fought my own little races with people
around me - I won some and lost some - the lady who finished just in front
of me was just that little bit quicker going downhill, and that was enough
for her to keep in front.</p>

<p>I enjoyed it much more - it was still tough, and I still suffered, but that&#8217;s
because I went much more quickly. I think the conditions might have been
slightly better (perhaps less humid)? but still, I shaved fifteen minutes off
my 2012 time.</p>

<p>Another excellent race/training run in preparation for the North Face, with
776m of ascent to add to the list. Hopefully I won&#8217;t feel so broken this
week and can up the volume again.</p>

<time datetime="2014-04-07T20:57:00+10:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Apr 7<span>th</span>, 2014</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was a casual question on my Wednesday night social trail run with
Bunyaville Trail Runners that prompted my entry to the Nerang 50 -
&#8220;Are you doing Nerang at the weekend?&#8221;. I didn&#8217;t even know it was on
but that question triggered a rapid succession of thoughts such
that by the time I got home I just needed to check a couple of things
before entering.</p>

<p>Once I&#8217;d checked the date and time, and that it wasn&#8217;t full, I checked
with Peta whether it was ok - she was sceptical that it was a sensible
idea six weeks out from North Face, questioned whether I would break
myself - but I managed to persuade her, and thus myself, that it wasn&#8217;t
a completely ludicrous idea.</p>

<p>And so at 3:50am on Sunday morning after less sleep than I&#8217;d have liked
I was getting out of bed and putting on my race gear, eating breakfast
and having a coffee, before a quick drive across to Albany Creek to pick
up Paul, a fellow runner, before a dash down the Pacific Motorway to the
velodrome at Nerang where the race starts.</p>

<p>After the usual pre-race preparation (race number, lube, sunscreen etc.),
I was ready for race start in good
time and after a few words about navigation from the race starter, we
were off. For about 200m before hitting a bottleneck (the stile into
the State Forest) and then came to a halt! Still, once through that
it was on and upwards. Even at 6am it didn&#8217;t take long to start
sweating!</p>

<p>I was very very conscious that it was going to be a tough day (my
initial estimate was around 6 hours) and my mantra of the first of the
two 25km laps was &#8220;nice and casual&#8221;. While on a course like that it&#8217;s
almost impossible to avoid being out of breath, it&#8217;s best to minimise
that as much as possible. As such, for most of the first lap, if I was
running, I was running at a pace that, at that temperature, I felt able
to run all day.</p>

<p>The first lap was fairly uneventful - I was about 20m behind Paul for
most of it, and it was good to travel at a very sustainable pace. By
the end of the lap, I was looking forward to a 5 minute breather at
the checkpoint as I refilled all my bottles. It was 9am at this point, and
warmed up. The idea of a second lap in those conditions when the first
really hadn&#8217;t been that easy (I distinctly remember thinking about not
looking forward to the second time around) was tough, but I&#8217;d made far
too many compromises in the first lap that not doing the second lap
would have made the whole day an absolute waste of time.</p>

<p>And so I continued onto the second lap. I knew I wasn&#8217;t running as much
but I didn&#8217;t really feel that uncomfortable - I managed to continue at
a pace that I could sustain in those temperatures. Sometimes cloud cover
really helped, sometimes there was a breeze, and those times were great
for the short period of time they lasted! But when I was running, I was
doing well, and overtaking other runners.</p>

<p>At about 5km into the run, I was just catching back up with Paul, who
hadn&#8217;t spent as long at the checkpoint, when I heard him asking someone
if they were ok. They said they were, so he carried on. I got to the
same person and he was just sitting there. I asked if he had everything
he needed, and at this point he said he was out of water. He said he was
ok and would carry onto the checkpoint, but I knew that wasn&#8217;t going
to happen without water. As I&#8217;d done a complete refill (so I probably
had 2.5 litres) I knew I could spare quite a bit so gave him what I thought
would get him through. I don&#8217;t really know what happened to him after
that - I would be surprised if he finished.</p>

<p>Anyway, with my load lighter I was able to push on through, and
a bit later passed Paul who was suffering from cramping, and
some of the other runners too. By
the time I got to the 37km checkpoint I was happy to be able to refill
my camelbak (my front bottles containing energy drink were about half
full still, so I left them as they were). I also had a couple of cups of
water and a couple of flat coke too.</p>

<p>My recollection of the second half of the first lap was that it was
the easier of the two halves, and that there were no real tough hills
after the &#8216;gutbuster&#8217; shortly after the midway checkpoint. How I managed
to forget so many hills within 25kms is beyond me - suffice to say there
was a lot of walking in that final quarter. It was also so hot that
even at the top of hills I was no longer able to run immediately. But
once I did get my breath back I was able to run - certainly it was never
really my legs that were holding me back.</p>

<p>I used my energy drinks as a kind of reward strategy - sipping on it every
so often to keep my spirits up. And once they were almost empty, I siphoned
some of my remaining water into them so that I could at least have some
vaguely flavoured water! I was a bit surprised at how little water I
finished with, considering.</p>

<p>The second half took about 3:25, probably just under half an hour slower
than the first half. Given the very different conditions, I&#8217;m happy with
that. I finished in 6:27 which, when comparing to races such as
Glasshouse 50 in similar temperatures but
less elevation, seems about right for me.</p>

<p>I do think it was an excellent training run, and gave me the opportunity
to test my race and nutrition strategies and suffer a little with heat
and elevation. I think it proves that I&#8217;m about six weeks ahead in my
training compared to this time last year (as I reckon I could have done
last year&#8217;s TNF 50 yesterday - TNF 50 is harder but cooler)
so just need to keep training well to be able to survive the 100.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll have to take this week as it comes - I wasn&#8217;t too sore or stiff this
morning but it could be worse tomorrow! And of course Saturday is Pinnacles
so we&#8217;ll see how Nerang affects that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In March I&#8217;ve felt like I&#8217;m going from strength to strength. I don&#8217;t
yet feel ready for the North Face 100km but if it was the 50, I reckon
I&#8217;d be all set! Still, a few more weeks of solid training and hopefully
I&#8217;ll be a lot readier.</p>

<p>As per the plan, I&#8217;ve been trying to get more specific in my training,
and including hills and steps in my runs. So I&#8217;ve incorporated hill
intervals up to the Story Bridge and down again, circuits of Kangaroo
Point steps, and long runs to Camp Mountain from Bunyaville and back.</p>

<p>Other than the last week, I&#8217;ve done over 60km per week, which is reasonable.
For April I think I&#8217;ll have to up my sessions to 5 per week, or start to go
very long if I&#8217;m to continue to increase distance and ascent.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using the last week of the month as a chance to recover and recharge
and replenish motivation. This week was well timed I had
the <a href="/article/2014/03/26/twilight-half-race-report/">Twilight Half</a> to recover from (a new PB of 1:39:35) and this Saturday
I had a brewery tour in the city - suffice to say a Sunday morning long
run yesterday was never on the cards.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t done quite so well at cross training - in January I was doing more
weights, and in February I was doing more yoga, now in March I wasn&#8217;t doing
either. But I did do some gardening and carpentry!</p>

<p>As usual the plan is more distance, more ascent, more steps. Also I need
to do more runs with my backpack and I still need to finish buying my
mandatory kit (at least I managed to book flights and accommodation in March).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been trying <a href="http://tailwindnutrition.com.au/">Tailwind</a>
energy drinks for run fuel - so far they seem very
good so I just need to check that I can cope with it on longer runs,
otherwise I&#8217;ll need a different nutrition strategy.</p>

<p>Less than seven weeks to go now, and I&#8217;m much much stronger than seven weeks
ago, just need to keep it up!</p>

<p>March stats:<ul>
<li>Distance: 233km</li>
<li>Ascent: 3946m according to Garmin - usual disclaimers apply
(seafront runs sometimes show up as 200m of ascent!).</li></ul></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve become less diligent at writing race reports over the past few years,
particularly for races that aren&#8217;t super special to me. However, there
are a few things worth noting from this race.</p>

<p>This was my first race of the <a href="http://www.twilightrun.com.au/">Twilight</a>
series. I&#8217;ve been wanting to do
another half marathon for a while, but this seems to have been the first
one that has suited me.</p>

<p>Due to the upcoming North Face race in less than two months, which really
is my absolute priority A race of the year, I couldn&#8217;t let this race distract
me. Obviously if you&#8217;re training for a 100km race, a side effect of that
is that a 21km race shouldn&#8217;t be a problem endurance wise - in
fact the weekend before I did a 4 hour 32 km hilly trail run which was
probably marathon level effort.</p>

<p>I also decided to experiment a little. Normally I&#8217;d taper for a race and
reduce volume significantly in the lead up to the run. This time I decided
that I&#8217;d reduce intensity a little and only do flat runs in the week
before, but I still did 42km in the week of the race.</p>

<p>The day leading up to the race itself was pretty uneventful. I decided I&#8217;d
go with another experiment, and use
<a href="http://tailwindnutrition.com.au/">Tailwind energy drink</a> in the hours
before the race to give myself extra fuel. I went for public transport
rather than car, and caught the train to Park Road and then walked across
the footbridge to the Boggo Road bus station (I have no idea why they can&#8217;t just
choose one name!) and then a quick bus ride on the busway to University
of Queensland St Lucia campus.</p>

<p>I meandered my way across campus following the herd of people to the start
(I figured if I followed the majority of runner-looking people, that would
likely work) and found the Parkrun tents and had a chat with various runner
friends - Jo, Kim and Neil from Sandgate, Andy from Bunyaville.</p>

<p>The max temperature of the day was supposedly 31C but by about 4pm it was
very comfortable in the shade, so I just had to hope the course wasn&#8217;t too
exposed before sunset.</p>

<p>After the 1km race had got underway, I found a spot in a suitable position
(between the 1:35 and 1:45 pacers) and got ready to set off. After the usual
preliminaries and preamble, we were off!</p>

<p>My strategy was to run comfortably for the first 16km and then allow myself
to get out of breath. There were a couple of exceptions on some of the hills
but mostly that worked well. I definitely remember thinking the first couple
of kms were quicker than I expected, but I settled into a rhythm after that
and my pace wasn&#8217;t a concern. I just tried to enjoy the sensation of running
well within myself and avoid working too hard.</p>

<p>I was very impressed with the volunteers - the girls of Clayfield College
were out in strength, in Mexican costume giving out water effectively and
being very supportive.</p>

<p>I found the temperature perfectly workable - I might have benefitted from
being a little bit cooler, it&#8217;s always difficult to say, but I never felt
like I couldn&#8217;t keep cool - the water stations certainly helped with my
thirst and keeping cool.</p>

<p>Once I&#8217;d got to the 16km point I knew I could open up a little if able -
but by that point maintaining current pace was all I could really do - i.e.
I was having to work harder and breathe harder to stay constant. But that
was fine.</p>

<p>In the last km I noticed lots of people trying to overtake, like they&#8217;d
suddenly been unleashed. However, I still found a little in the tank to
finish strong, and certainly the last full km was the second fastest of
the race (after the 2nd km), and the last 200m was very fast indeed
(sub 4:00/km!). So perhaps I could have paced it slightly better, but
that&#8217;s easy to say with hindsight.</p>

<p>After the race I had one of the most expensive ice coffees I&#8217;ve ever had
($7 - but it tasted worth every cent at the time), caught up with other
runners and then headed back to the bus station for a relatively
straightforward journey home.</p>

<p>I think my fuelling, tapering and transport decisions were all well-judged.
That&#8217;s not to say that none of them could be improved but I&#8217;m not unhappy
with any of them.</p>

<p>In all, given how I prepared, I think I was fortunate to do so well for
this race, and wonder how I&#8217;d do if I actually tapered, and did some
actual speedwork - I shaved 1m30s off my PB, but how much more potential
is there - perhaps I&#8217;ll try and find out for Twilight bayside at Wynnum in
Spring.</p>

<p>Final result: 1:39:35 <a href="http://www.strava.com/activities/123203444">race data</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>February was where my training started to come together. I would have likely averaged 50kms
per week were it not for a poor first weekend (I think I just tired myself out in the heat and gave
up 7km into a planned 21km run) and an
indisciplined last weekend (should have got up on the Friday morning before we went away
but was tired and hungover!).</p>

<p>Some very strong weeks including the first week with 56kms, and a good trip to Mount
Glorious for a shorter but hillier race than last year&#8217;s altered course to cover 22km in
2:43:47 with 1200m of ascent.</p>

<p>Also, I was back to Bunyaville most Wednesdays to rack up some more hills. I thought that my
month off hills might have worsened my performances but most sessions I felt as good as I have
done previously.</p>

<p>A hilly route around Shorncliffe has also been useful, but I think might pad out
the hills a bit too much - I might change over to a more intense session of hill and step repeats
(I trialled a version in the city yesterday and could do something similar locally).</p>

<p>Plans for March include more hills, more steps, and a half marathon race at Twilight. I also
need to start training with my backpack, start booking accommodation and flights for the North
Face, and ensure I have all the mandatory kit. Still ten weeks to go, but that&#8217;s feeling anywhere
near far enough right now!</p>

<p>February stats:<ul>
<li>Distance: 179km (same as January but in fewer days running)</li>
<li>Ascent: 2907m - much better than January, includes some genuinely hilly runs but still
  likely a massive overestimate.</li></ul></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>January wasn&#8217;t a terrible month - I ran every other day, and did upper body/core strength
training pretty much every day in between (I admit I missed a couple). Most weeks were around
the 40km mark, which is fine for the time being.</p>

<p>My Achilles niggle isn&#8217;t entirely gone away but I am recovering better and gathering more
strength. Today I went on my first trail run this year, and while it wasn&#8217;t 100%, it didn&#8217;t
impede me either, so I&#8217;ll be happy as long as it doesn&#8217;t feel terrible tomorrow.</p>

<p>Last week I ran one of my fastest 11km Wednesday nights for a while, so I do feel I&#8217;m
maintaining speed and so it&#8217;s just a matter of keeping uninjured and then building
endurance.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also entered my first race of the year - Mt Glorious mountain race. I&#8217;ll need to be
confident that I&#8217;ve recovered before I start, but it&#8217;s looking good so far. After that
I think I&#8217;ll go for Twilight half marathon and then Pinnacles in April. That might be it
for races before The North Face - last year I did Mt Mee marathon four weeks before, but
this year it&#8217;s just two weeks before.</p>

<p>In terms of how things could be improved, I need to do more hills, more steps and more
distance, but I plan on doing all of those.</p>

<p>January stats:<ul>
<li>Distance: 180km</li>
<li>Ascent: 1321m according to Garmin, probably only 200m really (a lot of flat
seafront runs show up as 200m of ascent!).</li></ul></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>2013 was a bit of a mixed year - I didn&#8217;t have the same kind of breakthrough successes as in 2012,
where I smashed 24 minutes off my 2011 marathon PB - indeed both 2012 marathons were better than my
2013 effort.</p>

<h2>Successes</h2>

<p>5km PB - I broke the PB I set at North Lakes (20:50) at New Farm (20:40), then again at Mitchelton (20:23).
I also bettered the time at Sandgate too (20:42). I also attended five courses new for me, including two
inaugural runs (Mitchelton, Bunyaville). I think I did around 25 park runs this year - just under one
a fortnight. I also did a few social runs with the Sandgate Parkrun spin-off, Bayside Breezers. One of
my happiest moments was pacing Dean, co-event director of Sandgate, to his 5km PB. Although amusingly
I later found that I&#8217;d been pacing someone else for the last km.</p>

<p>10km PB - this year I managed to get to the start of the Bridge to Brisbane on time which meant that the
traffic was far easier to negotiate, and I ran three minutes faster than the previous year. I wasn&#8217;t
100% fit so I know I can do better.</p>

<p>50km PB - this year I didn&#8217;t go the wrong way, and I just about made it home slightly quicker than last year.
I don&#8217;t think it was a better performance, but the heat got to me (the heat got to me the year before, so
who knows!)</p>

<p>The North Face 50 - I finished it. In a time I was ok with. I vowed to give up trail running during the event.
Of course I&#8217;ve since signed up for the 100km next year. But I do plan to be better prepared!</p>

<p>Lots of other trail races - Mt Glorious, Wild Horse 30km, Mt Mee to Dayboro trail marathon, Glasshouse 50km,
Beerwah at Night 30km. Lots of trail running with friends from Bunyaville Trail Runners.</p>

<h2>Failures</h2>

<p>Brisbane marathon - I did so well last year, and it wasn&#8217;t looking bad at the halfway point this year, but the
wheels fell off around 25kms in. I&#8217;d been suffering a little from injury, and suspect that while my speed
and stamina were still well trained, my endurance wasn&#8217;t sufficient. I suspect heat and nutrition issues, of
which the latter I must address in future.</p>

<p>Injuries in general - at one point I&#8217;d suffered almost every runner&#8217;s injury going in short succession -
shin splints, plantar fasciitis, hip flexor issues, pulled hamstring. Ok, so that leaves illiotibial band
and achilles tendonitis, but I managed to acquire the latter in the last run of 2013. Lessons learned are
to work on strength, core, balance and flexibility, and not to ramp up too much. Recovery will be key for me.
Also better warmups might have prevented niggles picked up at Kingscliff parkrun (hamstring) and Bunyaville
parkrun (achilles) - I must be more diligent about warming up.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t do a half marathon in 2013 - I missed both twilights (I can&#8217;t remember why I missed the first but
as it got stopped halfway through due to the storm (in which a runner was sadly hit by a falling tree and later died),
the reason why is relatively unimportant) and no others really took my interest.</p>

<p>The North Face was tougher than I expected, mostly due to the last 15km being more of a challenge - a lot
of steps. I could have found this out and been better prepared, even if only mentally! Still, at least I&#8217;m
forewarned for 2014.</p>

<h2>Lessons for 2014</h2>

<ul>
<li>Practice steps.</li>
<li>Warm up better.</li>
<li>Work on flexibility, strength and balance.</li>
<li>Try not to injure myself!</li>
<li>Get race nutrition right.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I signed up for the North Face 100km. I decided to take most of December easy, most weeks were 20km
tops, to give myself some downtime in preparation for nearly five months of buildup towards TNF100.</p>

<p>The last race of 2013 was supposed to be a nice sociable 5km at the recently created Bunyaville Parkrun.
I was there for the inaugural event and due to time pressures (I had a 9am ferry to North Stradbroke
Island to catch) I ran a 25 min PB in warmish conditions. Last Saturday I thought the conditions were
better, but maybe I wasn&#8217;t feeling the pressures, as I was a bit slower (20 seconds or so)</p>

<p>However, my Achilles took a battering. I&#8217;m not sure what if anything I did differently, but I&#8217;ve been
suffering since. I could barely walk on Sunday - I was kind of taking half steps until I realised I
wasn&#8217;t using my Achilles at all and overrode that.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve done some digging and found a great exercise, <a href="http://runnersconnect.net/running-injury-prevention/achilles-tendonitis-and-insertional-achilles-tendinopathy-in-runners/">eccentric heel drops</a>, that is already giving me some relief.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m reducing the intensity for the next week or so, and likely the volume will be low (although hoping to
manage 20-30km or so).</p>

<p>In addition, I&#8217;m adding strength, balance and flexibility to my training program. And if I can&#8217;t run,
well the pool will do (assuming I can actually get in the pool with everyone else avoiding the heat!)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Note: most of this was written Sunday afternoon - so although it&#8217;s
posted a few days late, it&#8217;s a fairly timely (and therefore more accurate)
recollection.</em></p>

<p>Last year&#8217;s Brisbane Marathon was the highlight of my running season - an
18 minute PB just five weeks after a 7 minute PB at Gold Coast, bringing my PB
down from 2011&#8217;s 3:54 to 3:30 after a solid few months training with a coach.
I&#8217;ve said since that it was the perfect race, the conditions were ideal for me,
my training had gone very well without injury.</p>

<p>The lead up to this year&#8217;s Brisbane Marathon has been a little different -
since Blue Mountains I just haven&#8217;t managed to achieve a level of consistent
running with which I can be happy - as alluded to in my two previous posts.
I haven&#8217;t really managed a run longer than about 25km since the Blue Mountains,
with most long runs being around the half marathon mark.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been succumbing to almost every runners niggle going - thankfully not
in a severe way but enough to make me feel the need to slow down. I&#8217;ve had
shin splints, plantar fasciitis, runners knee, hamstring and ITLB at one point
or another. Some of it might be new shoes, some of it might be old shoes
breaking down, and as I get used to new shoes or replace old shoes hopefully
I&#8217;ll get settled again.</p>

<p>So I had few expectations of today - I gave myself four days off to allow the
hamstring to recover sufficiently, and figured I&#8217;d see what happens. My ideal
target was a PB, but I realised that if I was actually capable of that, then
there was something wrong about my training plan. I&#8217;d have been happy with
sub-3:45, and content with sub 4:00.</p>

<p>As I started I felt good, and quickly settled into 5:00/km pace. As with last
year, my head said this seemed fast, but my body seemed fine with it -
no problems breathing at all, my legs felt light and painfree, and I was
having the best run I&#8217;d had in months.</p>

<p>This lasted nearly the whole first lap, although I think I started slowing
from onwards of 18km. The day started heating up, and I started to feel more
and more sluggish. By about 25km I was feeling that the rails had come off my
race and that it would be a sufferfest to the end. At this point my friend
Dave (who started in the zone behind mine) caught up with me, and kindly gave
me a gel, before heading on his own race, looking strong.</p>

<p><img src="/images/brismara2013_1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Between 29 and 30km, just after Victoria Bridge - by Peta</em></p>

<p>While the gel perked me up a bit, I think it caused some stomach issues, but
a quick pitstop and I could carry on - might have lost a minute or two but
sometimes when the race is going badly, and temperatures are heating up, an
enforced break can help.</p>

<p>However, this didn&#8217;t mean it wasn&#8217;t a sufferfest until the end. The highlights
from this point on were seeing Peta who&#8217;d come to spectate for the second lap,
just after Victoria Bridge (29km) and just before Go Between Bridge (35km),
and also the wonderfully crazy kids manning the water stalls, so supportive
and enthusiastic as ever! I got overtaken by the 3:45 pacer at the 32km mark
and tried my best not to let them get too far past without a struggle, but
I was pretty much cooked.</p>

<p>At a few water stops I tried the water over the head cooling method, which
provided some temporary relief, but I was in full-on ultra-event survival
mode by now - walking the hills, taking some walk breaks, anything I could
to just continue to the end.</p>

<p>The last few kms felt so far and so hard, I couldn&#8217;t even maintain 6:00/km
by this point as I was having to stop at water fountains or take quick breaks.
I even used the water stop at 41km, in spite of it &#8216;only&#8217; being another 1.2km.
Finally, I crossed the line in 3:52:07, and I was ok with that. My worst
road marathon on Australian soil, but still slightly better than London 2011.</p>

<p>The race execution felt a bit similar to London, in that I had an awesome
first half, although slowing towards the half way point, to get a positive
split of around 1:45 first half and around 2:00 second half. At least this
time, I can walk afterwards!</p>

<p>As with all my marathons, I suspect temperature played a massive part
(start temp was 6C, end temp was 20C), but
I may have stuffed up the nutrition too - I was hungry not long into the race.
That and the lack of long distance training all combined to play their part.
For all my niggles, I don&#8217;t think they really had a major effect on the race.</p>

<p>I might have a few days off running now, I&#8217;m shattered! [It&#8217;s now Wednesday,
and today I had my first run since Sunday (just 5km)]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I read an <a href="http://triathlete-europe.competitor.com/2011/09/22/three-rules-for-better-running">excellent article</a> recently simplifying running to
three rules - consistency, rest, and listening to your body.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not bad - my rule of thumb is train as consistently as you can without
getting injured - but that&#8217;s pretty much the same thing.</p>

<p>My recent aim has been to up my run volume in a consistent fashion towards 80km
per week, but I seem to be consistently achieving 50km/week as a result of
lack of runs or not long enough runs. This week I had
two great runs on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then a terrible run on Friday -
12km of just really slow suffering - I managed to just about pick up the pace
for the second half but it was very sluggish. Yesterday morning I had a nice
quick Sandgate parkrun, which made me feel confident again.</p>

<p>Today my plan was for a 24km run, but after about 8km I started noticing a
minor foot niggle that I&#8217;ve had before, but it usually happens at the start of
a run and goes away as my foot loosens up. Today it got worse to the point
where almost every step was slightly annoying (not really painful but twingey).
In the end I decided listening to my body was the right step, and packed it
in after just 12km. I did some stretching afterwards, and even got the foam
roller out when I got home, and just hope a couple of days rest is enough
to manage the niggle.</p>

<p>Assuming my foot does recover, I&#8217;ll run as normal on Tuesday and Wednesday.
This week I&#8217;m off to Sydney on Thursday for a conference on Friday and
Saturday, probably with evening events too, so consistency will be tricky
(particularly my usual Friday evening run). I plan
to do parkrun on Saturday morning at St Peters, so I might just have to add
Friday&#8217;s run to that (maybe run a bit of there and back if it&#8217;s runnable).</p>

<p>Hopefully I&#8217;ll have some weeks that boost my confidence overall soon!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With less than five weeks to go before the Brisbane marathon, I find myself
reflecting upon my training so far and to come.</p>

<p>I only have one goal for Brisbane, and that is to beat last year&#8217;s time. It&#8217;s
not impossible, and looking at my training times and parkrun results, it
should be doable. But it won&#8217;t be easy.</p>

<p>Since the North Face, I&#8217;ve tried to get up to a 60km/week training volume,
with the aim of reaching 80km at peak. But I haven&#8217;t been able to maintain
even 60km/week - either my legs give up, or last week, it seems my entire
body decided to go on strike (I wonder if I was fighting something off, I
had what is best described as a half hour cold on Friday night - sneezing,
runny nose, snuffles, the works, but it went as quickly as it came, and I&#8217;ve
felt great since)</p>

<p>We also had our wedding anniversary, where we went away to the Bunya
Mountains - not much running, but good hill walking - not very far, but
I definitely felt it, and again, a possible cause of last week&#8217;s lethargy.</p>

<p>So now, with five weeks to go, the last few weeks don&#8217;t look that great in
terms of consistency, but I have a great training base, the last couple of
runs have convinced me that I&#8217;m still fast enough, and so I just need some
decent long runs and hopefully I&#8217;ll be set.</p>

<p>On Sunday I did a half marathon in training in 1:50, today I did 15km in 1:15.
The latter is still a slower pace than last year&#8217;s Brisbane marathon though,
which absolutely stuns me - a 5:00/km tempo run feels like it should be fast
enough, but I need to be getting below 4:55/km on the day to actually beat
last year.</p>

<p>This year I&#8217;m uncoached, so it&#8217;s all down to me. Of course there are plenty
of variables (last year was almost perfect weather conditions for me) but
I&#8217;m happy with my performance overall, and I&#8217;m enjoying the social side
of running more than I ever have, with social runs and friendly competition
with my fellow Bunyaville Trail Runners and those at Parkrun. This has
also encouraged me to experiment with different runs (my two best parkruns
were both preceded by a 10km the evening before, which is new) to get the kms
in at the same time as the social side.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was mostly clear to me at the end of the North Face 50km event that I&#8217;d have
seriously struggled to complete the 100km. That&#8217;s not to say I couldn&#8217;t have
done, but it might have involved walking much of it (to be fair, that&#8217;s not
that different to the second half of the 50km, except that I do feel I ran
the majority of the runnable stuff, except for the brief point around 37km
where I was out in the sun and struggling to maintain mental discipline - and
it did only last a km or two). But to really feel like I succeeded at the
100km, I&#8217;d want to be running most of the way between the last checkpoint and
the finish.</p>

<p>Given that I don&#8217;t feel that I could have done the 100km this year instead
of the 50km, what would I need to do between now and a future such
opportunity?</p>

<h3>Hill training</h3>

<p>One of the two key things I took from the pre-race Runners Forum was that
Kilian Jornet (2011 winner, international trail running superstar) has
vertical training goals. So more important than kms clocked per week is
elevation achieved. To improve in the Blue Mountains, I need to do more
vertical distance, preferably over a continuous run (doing 30 sets is not the
same as running 5km uphill). These opportunities exist, and I do do hill work
but probably not in sufficient volume to be ready, yet.</p>

<h3>Step training</h3>

<p>There were an awful lot of steps in the Blue Mountains, far more than I
envisaged there could possibly be, even if a psychotic race director
routed you down and then back up every possible staircase (I&#8217;m not
convinced that isn&#8217;t the course). So, with that in mind, I need to do more
stairs and steps. While running up and down an office block is boring, it&#8217;ll
probably help, but I also need to find some uneven steps, as that is the
reality of running in the Blue Mountains.</p>

<h3>Distance training</h3>

<p>To get from 50km to 100km, I need to increase my weekly mileage. One
suggestion from the elites at the Runners Forum was to aim for weekly
kms the same as the race distance, which seems reasonable to me. I&#8217;d say
that&#8217;s conservative for marathons and 50kms, and for me ambitious for a
100km race (that&#8217;s about eight-ten hours running per week, depending upon
session speeds), but this is Fantasy North Face 100km.</p>

<h3>Fatigue training</h3>

<p>I should do some more running when I&#8217;m tired from previous runs, to simulate
how it feels at the 80km mark. That probably means back to back training runs
at the weekend, particularly considering the desire to get nearer to 100km
per week.</p>

<h3>Consistent training.</h3>

<p>My training has been fairly ad-hoc this year. It&#8217;s not been terrible, and I&#8217;m
not doing dissimilar kms than this time last year when I had a coach. I haven&#8217;t
used not having a coach to skip very many training sessions (but there have
been one or two). However, I haven&#8217;t achieved the levels of consistency that
I&#8217;ve been hoping for - doing 50km or more every week, without fail. I suspect
slotting in parkruns on Saturday morning haven&#8217;t helped - they do help with
fatigue training for the Sunday, but I should probably do more than just the
5km. However, having a weekly km or elevation target (rather than simply
aiming for 4 runs a week) would allow me to do parkruns, have them count
but not replace a full session.</p>

<h3>Normalise the distance</h3>

<p>At the moment, 50kms seem like a hard event, and 100kms seem very scary indeed.
And let&#8217;s not even think about 100 milers, for now. However, just as running
marathons seemed to make running marathons normal (to the extent where I
decided to do one five days before the race, three weeks before the North i
Face 50 and suffered no obvious issues as a result). So running 50kms and
longer on a more regular basis (not racing them, not running them hard, just
doing the distance), and long runs with a lot of time on my feet, could help
to get to a place where a 100km race is just a particularly long run.</p>

<h3>Weight</h3>

<p>I should probably be about 5kg lighter for an event with as many hills - or
indeed any event where I&#8217;m landing thousands of times! I&#8217;m working on this by
cutting down on excuses to binge - whether it&#8217;s too much alcohol (in an
evening or in a week), too much junk food, I just need to choose my battles
wisely and attempt to limit everything to moderation (including excess).</p>

<h3>Local knowledge</h3>

<p>As this is Fantasy North Face 100, I suspect that living in Leura or
Katoomba would be the ideal preparation, giving you the ability to get to
know the trails that much better. Both winners this year cited training
regularly on the course - I think Brendan is bit more local than Beth but
she still got there every couple of weeks. Short of moving house or burning
up a lot of aviation fuel, this one might have to stay fantasy. However,
there are training events on the course - if this was my A-race, perhaps
doing at least one would be of help.</p>

<h3>Don&#8217;t be afraid of the big races</h3>

<p>Brendan Davies, this year&#8217;s winner and new record-holder, did Ultra
Marathon Mount Fuji just three weeks before the North Face 100. That
goes against almost everything I&#8217;ve ever read regarding recovery times from
big races, and yet in his blog entry he says it helped him. I do understand
the theory - if you do a tough race beforehand, the legs will hopefully
recover even stronger afterwards, but it must be a real gamble. I certainly
don&#8217;t think Mt Mee three weeks before did me any harm, but the recovery
period in between might better be spent peaking in training. One to think
about, at least.</p>

<h3>Support</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s not impossible to do TNF100 without a support crew - I&#8217;m sure 100s of
people do it every year - the race logistics seem awesome, you can get drop
bags sent to whichever checkpoint they&#8217;re needed (I gather) - which means
you don&#8217;t have to carry every gram of kit for the whole race (e.g warm
clothes need only be picked up at checkpoint 4). But friendly faces and
encouraging words can definitely help. Involving the support crew in the planning
process is essential so that they know where to be at what times, and what I&#8217;m
likely to need. As with any endurance event that requires a lot of training,
having an early conversation with family about support levels and training
volumes and time away from home is better than having it too late.</p>

<h3>Planning</h3>

<p>It seemed that the planning needed for the 100 was significantly greater than
for the 50. I made some terrible choices that could have compromised my race,
but I got away with it because I was only doing the 50. Kit choice, drop bags,
nutrition strategies are all things I barely worried about for the 50 that
would require proper thought for the 100.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Am I going to go for it? I&#8217;m going to focus on my road running for the next
couple of months until Brisbane marathon, and then hopefully throw in a couple
more trail races before the end of September. There are 50 weeks until the
next North Face 100, and 102 until the one after that, so there&#8217;s no need to
hurry. I should bear all of the above in mind, as most of them are good for
trail running in general, a sport in which I aim to improve.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One week on, and a race report gets harder to write as memories of pain and
suffering fade. If I leave it much longer I might accidentally document that
it really wasn&#8217;t that different to the average walk in the park.</p>

<h2>The Day before</h2>

<p><em><a href="#raceday">Skip this section</a></em> if you just want the race details!<br/></p>

<p>I flew down to Sydney on the Friday morning, picked up my hire car from the
airport, and drove straight to Leura. I did want to get to my accommodation
as early as possible as the descriptions sounded sufficiently complicated that
I didn&#8217;t want to try it first in the dark. But I was hungry as it had gone 2pm
and I hadn&#8217;t been fed much on the flight. So I got to Leura, found a great
sandwich at Wazygoose and went for a wander to eat lunch in tranquility.</p>

<p>After lunch I bought dinner for the next two nights (bacon and courgettes and
mushrooms and pasta), cereal for the next two mornings (It was supposed to
be cereal and muesli but they didn&#8217;t have my type, and I rarely risk new
mueslis!). From there, it was back to Wentworth Falls and finding my cottage,
Wattle, at the end of a long and bumpy dirt track, which I was glad I tried in
daylight.</p>

<p>By now it was 4pm so I quickly moved some of my luggage around in a vague
attempt to start preparing for the morning, before heading back to Leura to have
a look at the North Face shop (lots of stuff I didn&#8217;t need and nothing I did
actually want) and listen to the Runners Forum, which had some great tips for
training and preparing for the race, but any really useful advice would be a bit
late by then! I also met up with Dave and discussed plans for car sharing for
the morning (parking wasn&#8217;t allowed anywhere near by so getting dropped off was
almost essential).</p>

<p>When I got back to the cottage I lit the fire, had dinner,
ensured all my stuff was in the
right place for the morning, chatted to Peta on the phone, read for a bit and
went to bed not long after 10pm. I had to be up at 6.30am, which is almost
a respectable time of day for this kind of thing.</p>

<p><a name="raceday"></a></p>

<h2>Race Day</h2>

<p>In the morning I had breakfast and a cup of tea, sorted out what I was
wearing in the race, what I&#8217;d take until leaving the car and what I&#8217;d have in
the bag for emergencies. I had a good idea what the temperatures would be (a
low of 6, a high of 16) but didn&#8217;t really know what that would feel like. I
was also worried about cooling down in the case of injury or getting lost, and
so wanted to pack conservatively. But even so, I think I packed too much stuff,
which would have consequences later.</p>

<p>I got to Dave&#8217;s, dropped off my car there for the rest of the day along with
my fleece, and we headed to the start with his parents. We had some fun taking
some photos and then it was time to head to the race briefing. The first wave
went not long after at 8:50am, and then at 8:55am, it was time for us to go!</p>

<p>The first couple of km were around the Fairmont Resort golf course, which
was certainly hilly enough for me to slow down to a walk and be out of breath
within a km. I don&#8217;t have any timings as I&#8217;d turned my watch on before leaving
home, told it &#8216;yes, I am indoors&#8217; and then forgot to turn GPS back on when
going outside. I managed to fix that on the run, but only after a couple of kms.</p>

  <img class="img-thumbnail" src="/images/thumbs/tnf_through_the_tennis_courts.jpg" alt="" title="Running through the tennis courts (Dave)"></a></p>

<p>After about 3km we started heading down some steps, and then the bottlenecks
started to become apparent. This is always likely to be an issue, as some
people are good at steps but slower at running, and others like me are middle
of the pack at running and terribly slow at steps. I tried to let obviously
faster people through, particularly when the faster third wave runners caught
up, but it was the same for everyone really. I never minded (unless I was
holding people up), a slow pace up steps just keeps me well below threshold.</p>

<p><a class="fancybox" rel="tnf50" href="/images/tnf_pro_down_steps.jpg">
  <img class="img-thumbnail" src="/images/thumbs/tnf_pro_down_steps.jpg" alt="" title="Running down the steps (Aurora)"></a></p>

<p>There were some ladder climbs to get back up the cliff, then some biggish hills
before we hit dirt track and then road on the way to the checkpoint. I&#8217;d thought
the checkpoint was at 15km, so was surprised when someone said it was only a
couple of kms, but my watch being 2.5km behind, and the checkpoint being at
12km combined to make it arrive quite soon.</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t able to fill my bladder very much at the checkpoint - my bag was full
and compressing the bladder. I could have taken some stuff out, and repacked it
again, but I took the risk with it being a cooler day.</p>

<p>The next 10km were downhill, pretty much, so that I did them in about 50 minutes
to take me to the 2 hour point at the 20km marker. After this I calculated it
would be mostly uphill for the next 3 hours (based on 5km/h which was what I
was doing when walking). There were the odd few kms where I was able to run for
a while, meaning that I was getting 5kms done in 50 mins rather than the hour,
but I realised I&#8217;d need that for the steps, where I&#8217;d get no horizontal
distance in a lot of time! I could see the Three Sisters from below at one point
which was quite exciting.</p>

  <img class="img-thumbnail" src="/images/thumbs/tnf_three_sisters_below.jpg" alt="" title="Three Sisters from below"></a></p>

<p>I took a bit of a sitting break around the 30km mark to get some food and
water into my system before the last couple of kms before the steps. As
expected, the steps were hard, and took a while, and a few breathers to get
to the top, but finally I made it!</p>

<p><a class="fancybox" rel="tnf50" href="/images/tnf_pro_top_of_furber.jpg">
  <img class="img-thumbnail" src="/images/thumbs/tnf_pro_top_of_furber.jpg" alt="" title="At the top of the Furber Steps! (Aurora)"></a></p>

<p>From there it was roads to Checkpoint 2. I ran those I could, and walked the
hills, but I made it to the checkpoint with about five minutes to go before
the 5 hour mark. I hoped to be out by 5 hours, but I faffed around for a bit
(I wasted time going to the toilet - it was near the entrance but I only
found this out at the food station on the opposite side of the hall). I
took down a lot of melon, had some energy drink and water and a few chews.
I put what I thought to be a sensible amount of water in my bladder, but
didn&#8217;t fill it, as I just had the last 14km to Leura - how hard could that be?
In the end I got out just after the five hour mark.</p>

<p>At this point I was hoping for sub 7 - I realised 14km in 1:30 was likely to
be unrealistic, but surely 7km an hour was doable. Even though I&#8217;d just had
a break, I found it very difficult to maintain a good running pace for the next
couple of kms, I would have to run and then walk. I realised shortly after
that those two kms (and a few beforehand) were completely exposed, and once
I got back in the shadow of the cliffs I was able to maintain a decent pace,
when I could actually run.</p>

<p><a class="fancybox" rel="tnf50" href="/images/tnf_pro_under_rocks.jpg">

  <img class="img-thumbnail" src="/images/thumbs/tnf_pro_along_the_cliff_tops.jpg" alt="" title="Cruising along the cliff tops (Aurora)"></a></p>

<p>My memories of the last 10km are just one set of steps after another. I felt
able to run when the track was runnable, but there were sections where I&#8217;d
descend 200m vertical in steps, and then almost immediately ascend again.
There were more kms which took 24 mins (so joint slowest with the Furber
Steps!) and it just felt relentless, particularly around the Leura Cascades.
When I got to the top of the Olympian Rock
lookout, someone said &#8220;it&#8217;s runnable for a bit now&#8221; and it was, but that bit
was very short as I went down towards Gordon Falls! Suddenly we were off the
tracks and onto tarmac, and then it was just the couple of kms. At
this point my water error had finally materialised and I was totally out,
but thankfully I no longer needed any. Indeed, the last
km was very runnable (i.e. it was mostly downhill) and so at least I felt
that I finished strongly - in fact, my best km since around the 18km mark.</p>

<p>After the finish gear check I collected my medal and tshirt,
grabbed some water, and energy drink and
a couple of sausages, and then went to get myself together so that I could
let Peta know that I was safe, and call Dave and find a lift home. Dave
actually found me, and then sorted me a cup of tea, and we compared stories.
It was reassuring to know he&#8217;d found it just as tough, particularly the steps.
He even said he&#8217;d found it tougher than last year, although I do wonder
whether the memories of last year had faded!</p>

  <img class="img-thumbnail" src="/images/thumbs/tnf_dave_will_finish.jpg" alt="" title="Dave and Will at the finish (Chris)"></a></p>

<p>My final time was 7:24:52, and I was 130th out of 266 runners. I was very
happy with that, and pleased not to have to run another 50km. While
on the course, at one point I gave up on my goal of ever doing
Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc, and then even considered retiring from running
entirely!</p>

<h2>Photography notes</h2>

<p>Many of the photos are from <a href="http://auroraimages.com.au">Aurora
Images</a>, the professional photographers on the course. I
have noted these with (Aurora) in the photo titles.</p>

<p>David Abrey took the photos credited with (Dave), Chris Abrey took the one
credited with (Chris).</p>

<p>A couple of photos were
taken by fellow competitors while on the run, apologies for lack of credit.</p>

<h2>Inspirational race reports</h2>

<p>Well, mine is a report from the middle of the pack. The winners&#8217; race reports
are happily both online and make for inspiring reading, perhaps because they&#8217;ve
both come such a long way in the last few years - I&#8217;m sure they both have
innate talent too, but working hard can make a big difference:</p>

<h2>The Day After</h2>

<p>I went to find Bridal Veil falls, which Peta tried to show me seven years ago
on our first trip together to Australia, after several years of drought, and
the falls looked a bit pathetic. It looked much better! I also took a trip to
Cliff View lookout at Katoomba, and Wentworth Falls lookout. It was a
beautiful day and I was happy to be walking without too much pain (down steps
was the only tough move). I bumped into a guy who&#8217;d done the 100 and was out
with his family, and had a nice chat with him. I badgered some other tourists
to take my photo at Cliff View.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With just 12 days to go until the race, things are definitely getting
exciting. My race pack arrived today, with map and race number!</p>

<p><img src="/images/tnf50.jpg"/></p>

<p>Had a great run up Camp Mountain today with the Bunyaville Trail Runners,
I didn&#8217;t manage to run all the way to the top, but given I had my full race
pack on in training for the race I didn&#8217;t mind too much. And I made up for
it on the downhills, they felt great.</p>

<p>Training wise, I feel in a good place - my legs feel in great shape.</p>

<p>Looking at the conditions in the mountains, if it&#8217;s like today, the starting
temperature will be not much above zero and max temperature below 20C.
I might need to take some warmer clothes than I was planning - but those
conditions would be ideal for me!</p>
