I am currently a lapsed Iron-distance triathlete, with Challenge Henley 2011
and Ironman Zurich 2010 to my name, but no current triathlon plans at all.

I moved to Australia in December 2011 and have since concentrated on my
running - completing Gold Coast marathon and Brisbane marathon in July and
August respectively. 

My current focus is on long-distance trail running with a plan to move to the
100km distance in 2013 and perhaps the 100 mile distance in 2014, with a view
to at least qualifying for Ultra Trail Mont Blanc, even if not competing in it.
