I haven't updated this blog since Challenge Henley. I've barely <em>trained</em> since Challenge Henley. 

Three months off has done me no good at all. Drinking and eating my way through a north American winter and then landing in an Australian summer has done me no good at all either. 

My plans for 2012:<ul>
<li>Complete a triathlon</li>
<li>Lose 8kg and 2in (the impact of just three months slacking)</li>
<li>Start shaving significant time off my 1500m swim (sub 30?)</li>
</ul>
While completing a triathlon might not seem much of a goal for someone with two Ironmans behind them, I really have got so far behind in my training and I need to start learning to race in the Australian summer (not to mention calm my fear of jellyfish/sharks/blue-ringed octopus). 

NB: my training log is not up to date as the USB stick for data transfer from my watch is hopefully in shipping (if not it's lost) - either way the total is 1 run in October, 4 in December and 1 in January. Not great.
