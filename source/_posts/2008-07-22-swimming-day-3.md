<p>I still don't seem to *like* swimming that much! I am improving, however, I managed possibly 5 lengths in one go, but definitely two sets of at least 4 lengths! I am trying to improve my stroke technique, my breathing, and my kicking, although rarely managing all three at the same time! </p>
<p>I think it's the breathing that I'm struggling with most, and the pacing - I seem to start off flailing like a windmill, knacker myself out, move my arms more slowly as a result and then be swimming more efficiently and easily. I should remember to start like that!</p>
<p>My second set of 4x25m was done in 2m35. I'm pretty sure that's damn slow!</p>
<p>I know my positioning isn't great because I'm still struggling with exhaling underwater, so my head tends to be above water far more than it should be. However, I will persevere, and I will get better!</p>
<p>Things to consider:<br />
Swimming lessons!<br />
Nose clip?<br />
Paddles? Fins? Floats? (I think they'd be useful for drills *after* the lessons!)</p>
