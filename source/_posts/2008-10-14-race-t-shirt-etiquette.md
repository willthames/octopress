It seems a few people in yesterday's half marathon hadn't read the guide to <a href="http://badbenkc.blogspot.com/2007/09/proper-t-shirt-etiquette.html">Proper Race T-shirt etiquette</a>, as there were plenty of people wearing the t-shirt for the actual race! Shock horror!

I look forward to returning next year, in this year's t-shirt, of course.
