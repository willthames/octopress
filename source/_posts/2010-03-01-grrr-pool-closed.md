Fitting in three pool sessions around everything else is tricky. As a result, I typically swim in the morning on Monday and Wednesday, due to other constraints. Yesterday I restricted my alcohol intake to a glass of wine with dinner, and went sure we went to bed at a reasonably sensible hour, and set my alarm for 06:45. I didn't sleep brilliantly, so I didn't quite get up then, but nevertheless I was at the pool for 07:30. I could see the pool was empty, excitingly, as I love having the pool to myself. 

Unfortunately this was accompanied by a sign saying 'Pool closed until further notice' - apparently they are having technical problems. So no swim for me today :(. I hate getting up early for no good reason!
