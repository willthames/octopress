<h3>Number of training hours (done/planned)</h3>
Swim: 3.5/3
Bike: 0.75/2.25
Run: 1.25/1.75
Core/weights: 0.0/0.5
Total: 5.55/7.5

<h3>What went well</h3>
Set up my <a href="http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/willthames">fundraising page</a> to raise money for the Anthony Nolan Trust. Went running in the dark twice after work to ensure I kept up a reasonable schedule. Three good length swims are always an achievement to be happy with. 

<h3>What didn't go well</h3>
Turned into an epic week at work, particularly the weekend, so didn't make all planned exercise sessions. Bike suffered as usual. 

<h3>Thoughts for next week's plan</h3>
Will take some time off in lieu assuming work is not as disastrous, and make up training. It's still early in the build-up so I can afford a quieter week, and a rest week may well be beneficial, so I shouldn't feel the urge to make it all up next week. A good couple of long runs and bikes are my major goals for next week, time and work permitting.
