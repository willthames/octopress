A year ago, while still on wordpress.org, I wrote <a href="/2008/08/16/what-would-i-want-from-an-ideal-training-blog">a few aims</a> for what I'd like to have on my ideal blog. 

Looking at what I have now, I haven't done so well at achieving all of that - the best I have is my race entries. I just haven't been that motivated to do the rest, although with the Content Construction Kit and Views, I know it's all possible. 

What I'd like in future is<ul><li>Race splits for multi-sport - I have the data, I just need to display it</li>
<li>To start to use the Gallery</li>
<li>A bit of a redesign - the site looks a bit too slashdot-like at the moment - probably the white on darkslategray that does it!</li></ul>

Interestingly having looked at my previous entry, the only thing I still think would be exciting to do would be to pull the training data from my Forerunner - only trouble there is that Peta borrows it from time to time!
