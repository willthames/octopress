Cut short a little way, because there was an aquafit session in the pool starting about 25 mins after I arrived, so managed to get 20 mins in.

Did four consecutive lengths twice, mostly maintaining reasonable form and style. I timed the second set, and I think I managed 2:30, but as per usual, I might have misread the clock. I really do need a lap timer.

Swum several other lengths, trying out various paces and techniques, but nothing as formal as drills yet. I have been in contact with SwimForTri, so am waiting to hear back on a quote now.
