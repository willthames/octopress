<h3>What went well</h3>
Excellent long bike, excellent long run, a reasonable number of training hours done. 

<h3>What didn't go well</h3>
Fell off my bike, which hurt, missed a lot of swimming and cycling - mostly due to social commitments - although struggling with the front mech for an hour instead of training for an hour didn't help.

<h3>Thoughts for next week's plan</h3>
I didn't actually have a plan for this week - just a planned number of sessions. I think in general I'll continue with that - I know I want to get three swims, three bikes and three runs done per week, so it's just a matter of fitting them in where I can. Anything more structured than that seems to fail when it meets the real world.
