I just wanted to create a record of what I got for Christmas 2008 (tri-related goodies only).

<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wild-Swim-Places-Outdoors-Britain/dp/0852650930">Wild Swim</a>, the book of the <a href="http://www.outdoorswimmingsociety.com/">Outdoor Swimming Society</a>. Came with a silicon Christmas Pudding swim hat, which looks silly and cool at the same time, I think. 
Petzl Myo XP
Garmin cycle mounting kit

The book will be great inspiration to do more (i.e. any right now) outdoor swimming, the light should mean that I do more interesting running, and the cycle mount kit should make my rides a little more interesting, particularly once I get the Garmin cadence kit!
