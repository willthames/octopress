<h3>What went well</h3>
Made it out for the long bike, a good solid 4+ hour ride. Did all three swim sessions. 

<h3>What didn't go well</h3>
Long ride was supposed to be Saturday but got canned due to hangover and lack of organisation from my side, in terms of just getting there. Made up for it today, but meant that the long run got missed. Also missed a roller session and its companion core session. 

<h3>Thoughts for next week's plan</h3>
More cycling, as usual. And also more running. Perhaps the same amount of swimming, happy with that at least.
