<a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/31389590">Playa Blanca to Timanfaya via El Golfo</a>

<a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/31389579">Playa Blanca to just past Maguez</a> (ride abandoned due to genuine danger of aquaplaning in torrential rain - rare for Lanzarote!)

<a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/31389567">Playa Blanca to Orzola</a> - better route finding past Maguez this time allowed me to take more direct route to Orzola (if the section between Haria and Maguez looks long, it was significantly flatter than the direct route)
