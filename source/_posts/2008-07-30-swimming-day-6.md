Approximately 8 or so individual lengths focussing on breathing. Followed by 8 consecutive lengths, in a time of 5:30 (poor - I read <a href="http://www.netlag.com/amy/LP2008/index.html">an Ironman race report</a> today where the woman did the 2.4 miles (3.9km) swim in 1:58/100m - so basically she swam 18.5 times further at a significantly faster speed). I still suck at swimming! I then did a couple of lengths focussing on breathing again, before calling it an evening.

Ah well, it's still exercise, but I do need to start properly looking at coaching! However, my sports club has <a href="http://www.ccsclub.co.uk/triathlon.html">Triathlon nights</a> on Tuesdays, which might be worth a look (if only for them to say 'get out of our pool and get some coaching before coming back!')
