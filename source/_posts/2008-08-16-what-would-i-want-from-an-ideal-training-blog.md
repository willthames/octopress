I'm quite enjoying using Wordpress to manage my training blog. I'm only using the basic functionality, and I'd like more training specific components

What I'd ideally like is: <ul>
	<li>A way of entering what I've bought, where, for how much, and for what, as a means of managing my expenditure, and of course of displaying that information (I already have a private Expenses page, this would replace that)</li>
	<li>A way of easily entering my Training Log information in a form, and then automatically updating the table. Even better, that component could pull from Garmin Connect so I don't have to enter everything (although I might choose to correct it (e.g. sometimes I forget to stop my timer before walking home, so my run distances would be exaggerated)</li>
	<li>I'd like that same information in a side bar - e.g. Week 10: Swam 400m, Cycled 20km, Ran 20km</li>
	<li>Personal bests</li>
	<li>Race status</li>
</ul>

I'd have to go to a commercial platform for this functionality, and probably have to write the plugins myself, but neither of those is insurmountable - more of an issue is finding the time to research and code the extensions.

However, this entry will help me focus my attention on what I actually want on top of basic functionality.
