Now I'm doing 30 mins consecutively!

Goals for this week:<ul><li>Swim Twice.</li><li>Do two lots of 30 mins constant running.</li><li>Do 9-10km long run at the weekend.</li><li>Go to see some of the London Triathlon.</li></ul>
From now on I'm going to concentrate on one weekly long run, and leave the other two sessions as easier runs, just focussing on maintaining a reasonable pace that'll let me finish a half-marathon. I'll start worrying about PBs etc. next year.

I will however investigate what runner plans there are to bridge 8 weeks and half marathon, that can do it in 10 weeks...
