So, I'm now signed up with <a href="http://www.swimfortri.co.uk">Swim For Tri</a> for a sixth month course, which should take me from Novice to Advanced. The course incorporates weekly training schedules to complete on my own, including both fitness and drills sessions, six sessions in an Endless Pool to have my technique videoed and a DVD of drills.

The next stage after that will probably be a second six month course incorporating open water swimming.

They didn't laugh at me for saying that I wanted to be able to do 1500m in open water within a year, which I take to be a good sign!

I have my first endless pool session booked for Saturday at 11am. So I should probably try for a quiet night on Friday!
