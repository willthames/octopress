What I'm about to show here might just look like the standard output from e.g. mapmyrun or similar. It's not. It's a map taken from exported Ascent CSV data and converted to a Google Map using a ruby script. 

Script is still a work in progress, but it's reasonably well modularised - the code that turns a training session into a google map is totally separate to the bit that creates a training session from an Ascent CSV file. Meaning that I can make a new parser that creates a training session from a TCX file, or create a graph from a training session. 

Just need to automate it better or work out how to integrate it with drupal better- at the moment it just loads an iframe.
