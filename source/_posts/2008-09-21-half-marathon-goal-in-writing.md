I've been a bit unsure about how fast I'd be able to do the half marathon, but recent runs suggest that a 2 hour goal is not impossible for me.

I was planning on just wanting to finish, but in my heart, I know that I do want to do it in under 2 hours, so I'm declaring that as my goal for the race. I'm not going to be devastated if I don't achieve it, but I will be really pleased if I do!
