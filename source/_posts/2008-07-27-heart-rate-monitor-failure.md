So, as mentioned, I had problems with the Heart Rate Monitor on my Garmin Forerunner 405. Given that I've had no issues with the HRM in the past 6 weeks or so since I got the Forerunner, I have three possible theories:
<ul>
	<li>Firmware upgrade from 2.10 to 2.20</li>
	<li>Low battery on a 6 week old HRM</li>
	<li>It was hot and humid today, so I sweated more than normal</li>
</ul>

My understanding is that sweat is good for HRM connectivity, although I could be wrong. Still, I've posted this to the Runner's World <a href="http://www.runnersworld.co.uk/forum/forummessages.asp?chklast=1&amp;URN=5&amp;UTN=97268&amp;source=forumnot&amp;#363562">forum</a> to see if anyone has any answers

<b>Update: 30/07/2008</b>: I ran at 7am yesterday, and had no problems. From the list of possible causes above, the only thing that differed was the heat and humidity - I sweated less. I can only conclude from this that the cause was almost certainly the heat in one way or another!
