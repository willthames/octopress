# Mandatory kit
* <span class="ok">1 x waterproof and breathable jacket with fully taped
  waterproof seams and hood (plastic rain poncho, wind jacket, water resistant
  jacket etc. not acceptable)</span> - I scored at the Columbia store with 
  a half-price rainproof soft-shell. In orange. 
* <span class="warn">1 x High Visibility Safety Vest that complies with
  Australian Standard AS/NZS 4602:1999 –D/N Class for day and night time wear.
  Need to check it covers my backpack - it is on the large side but might 
  need a larger one.
* <span class="warn">1 x mobile phone (Telstra Next G is strongly recommended
  as coverage on the course is far better than any other network)</span> - I
  have a phone, but not Telstra. But I can get a SIM for $30, or it might be
  worth getting a cheapy PAYG phone rather than risk my smartphone.
* <span class="ok">1 x emergency space blanket, light bivvy sack or
  equivalent</span>
* <span class="ok">1 x compression bandage minimum dimensions 7.5cm wide x
  2.3m long unstretched. If in doubt the wrapping should list ‘heavy weight
  cotton crepe bandage’ or ‘heavy cotton elastic bandage’ (this item is used
  for the treatment of sprains or snake bite).</span>
* <span class="ok">1 x lightweight Dry Sack to keep your compulsory clothing
  dry (plastic bags or zip lock bags are fine but Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil dry
  sack is recommended)</span>
* <span class="ok">Capacity to carry 2 litres of water (water bladder or
  water bottles)</span>
* <span class="warn">2 x bars / food portions</span> - need to decide what to
  take here!
* <span class="ok">1 x Ziploc bag for your personal rubbish</span>
* <span class="warn">1 x waterproof map case or any other way to keep your maps
  protected such as map contact</span> - I should have one somewhere!

# Other useful stuff
* Freezer packs to keep water bladder cooler
* Blister plasters
* Spare socks
