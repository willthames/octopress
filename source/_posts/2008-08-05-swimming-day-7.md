Starting to feel a bit more streamlined in the water. Managed two consecutive lengths using what I consider to be correct style. Didn't bother with any endurance efforts, as I think they just reinforce bad habits. From now on my endurance efforts will be to improve on two consecutive lengths! Had another read of the drills section in a copy of Triathletes' World, so will start to incorporate some drills into my sessions.

Oh, and must contact normtheshark, to see when he could do 6 sessions at Charing Cross Sports club coaching my swimming.
