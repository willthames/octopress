Someone on <a href="http://www.tritalk.co.uk">Tritalk</a> suggested a challenge for December, an <a href="http://www.tritalk.co.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?t=74357">Advent daily run challenge</a>.

This started on Advent Sunday, meaning it includes a bit of November too, so yesterday I completed my first week ever of running daily. Before now I don't think I've run on consecutive days more than a couple of times, if that. 

The snow didn't help, of course. I'm planning on getting some Springyard Cross Country ice grippers to run on ice, but this week I could only hit the treadmill for two days before the thaw.
