Now that I've entered the North Face 50km, it's time to track my mandatory 
kit.  I don't want to have any expensive surprises (or even any cheap ones 
that I realise too late)

* <span class="ok">1 x long sleeve thermal top (polypropylene, wool or
  similar). Cotton, coolmax, lycra and any compression garment will not be
  sufficient even if the compression garment is called a "thermal compression
  garment". You may still use compression garments however they do not replace
  this mandatory item.</span>
* <span class="fail">1 x waterproof and breathable jacket with fully taped
  waterproof seams and hood (plastic rain poncho, wind jacket, water resistant
  jacket etc. not acceptable)</span> - I probably need a lighter and more 
  compressible coat than my ski jacket or Rohan coat
* <span class="ok">1 x beanie, balaclava or buff</span>
* <span class="fail">1 x High Visibility Safety Vest that complies with
  Australian Standard AS/NZS 4602:1999 –D/N Class for day and night time wear.
  It must be made of a combination of retroreflective and fluorescent
  materials. This is not a running vest but a workwear vest. It can be
  purchased at hardware stores or workwear stores for about $20. Your vest must
  have AS/NZS 4602:1999 or AS/NZS 4602:2010 as well as Class "D/N" on the tag.
  This must be worn on road sections at night. The vest must be clearly visible
  from both the front and the back, even when wearing your backpack so you must
  have an oversized vest that covers your whole torso AND your backpack.</span>
* <span class="ok">1 x headlamp (test your headlamp on bush tracks at night
  prior to the event to make sure it provides enough light to both see the
  track and the course markings).</span>.
* <span class="warn">1 x mobile phone (Telstra Next G is strongly recommended
  as coverage on the course is far better than any other network)</span> - I
  have a phone, but not Telstra. But I can get a SIM for $30, or it might be
  worth getting a cheapy PAYG phone rather than risk my smartphone.
* <span class="ok">1 x compass for navigation in the very unlikely event that
  you get lost.  While we recommend a good quality compass such as the Silva
  Field 7, you can bring any small compass as long as the magnetic needle will
  settle quickly and will point to magnetic North. A waterproof watch compass
  is allowed as long as you can calibrate it and use it correctly. An iPhone
  compass is not acceptable as it is not waterproof and the batteries may be
  needed for making emergency calls.</span>
* <span class="ok">1 x whistle</span>
* <span class="fail">1 x emergency space blanket, light bivvy sack or
  equivalent</span>
* <span class="warn">1 x compression bandage minimum dimensions 7.5cm wide x
  2.3m long unstretched. If in doubt the wrapping should list ‘heavy weight
  cotton crepe bandage’ or ‘heavy cotton elastic bandage’ (this item is used
  for the treatment of sprains or snake bite).</span> - need to check the
  contents of my first aid kit
* <span class="fail">1 x lightweight Dry Sack to keep your compulsory clothing
  dry (plastic bags or zip lock bags are fine but Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil dry
  sack is recommended)</span>
* <span class="warn">Capacity to carry 2 litres of water (water bladder or
  water bottles)</span> - need to check my bladder capacity, it might be only
  1.5l
* <span class="warn">2 x bars / food portions</span> - need to decide what to
  take here!
* <span class="warn">1 x Ziploc bag for your personal rubbish</span>
* <span class="warn">1 x waterproof map case or any other way to keep your maps
  protected such as map contact</span> - I should have one somewhere!
* <span class="ok">1 x set of maps and course descriptions (provided by
  organisers in your race pack). You will need to protect these from getting
  wet (using item above)</span>
* <span class="ok">1 x A5 Participant Emergency Instructions card on waterproof
  paper (provided by organisers in your race pack)</span>
* <span class="ok">1 x race number with timing chip to be worn on your front
  and visible at all times (provided by organisers in your race pack). A
  recommended method of securing your race number is to use an elastic waist
  strap like a triathlon band which allows you to easily have your number
  visible over the top of your outermost item of clothing. You will need to
  provide your own elastic waist strap if you choose to do this.</span>

I'm going to likely need a new backpack to put it all in too - can't see that
all fitting in my current Salomon bag!
