April was a productive month in running terms, with lots of events specific
to training for The North Face 100. 

In my [Fantasy North Face](/article/2013/06/01/fantasy-north-face-100km/) post,
I mention a few key things I thought I needed to do to be 100km ready. One of
those was normalising the distance. With that in mind I did 
[Nerang 50km](/article/2014/04/07/race-report-nerang-50km/) as a
fantastic race tune-up run, with no specific preparation &mdash; I signed up on the
Wednesday and did it on the Sunday. 

I also mentioned hill training, which is what I was doing two weeks later when
I ran a [marathon around Camp Mountain](/article/2014/04/20/ninth-times-a-charm-a-marathon-on-camp-mountain/) &mdash; which
was a 42.9km run with 2400m of elevation. That was also a good opportunity
to test running with full race kit and test nutrition and hydration strategies.

In between those I did a nice short sharp race at the
[Pinnacles](/article/2014/04/13/race-report-pinnacles-2014/) event.

My weekly volume has averaged on the high side &mdash; I'd planned to do 70km a week &mdash; I
took a short week of just 51km the week after my 50km after Nerang, but the 
other weeks beat the target (by 15km in two of the other weeks!).

All in all, I could feel more ready, but I've been pushing my body to do 
what I've felt physically and mentally capable of. Just over two weeks
until the main event! This week will be another 70km week and then I'll reduce
volume and probably elevation too so that I stop feeling so bloody tired every
time I run!

And I got my mandatory kit signed off, so that's one less thing to do at race
registration. Still going to be a busy Friday afternoon given the mandatory
race briefing at 7:30pm plus registration etc.

April stats:<ul>
<li>Distance: 323km</li>
<li>Ascent: 7918m according to Garmin &mdash; usual disclaimers apply.</li></ul>
