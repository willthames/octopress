Goals for last week:<ul><li>Swim at least once</li><li>Run at least twice</li></ul>

Thu: Ran from Clovelly Beach to just North of Bondi Beach via the coastal path, and back. A beautiful but hilly route in cool weather, giving a pretty much perfect run of around 7km including warm up.
Sun: A repeat of the previous Sunday's effort, a bit more running this time - another 15km run/walk.

So, one goal met, one goal failed - no swimming at all in Australia

With Australia over, it's time to get back to normal. Early indications are that this week will just about get me back on track, I should achieve 3 runs, even if not 2 swims, and I hope to return to normal training sessions from next week.

This week is an oncall week, so I'm keeping my goals realistic (going for a run or a swim after work is much less practical, for example)

Goals for this week: <ul><li>Run three times</li><li>Swim once</li><li>Do some work on Wordpress plugins!</li><li>Produce a new training schedule - this has been a missed goal several times</li></ul>
