<p>I am a total novice to triathlon. While I've run in the past, and cycled in the past, and even swum in the past, I certainly currently lack the endurance to do all three in one go. </p>
<p><b>Swim</b><br />
My weakest discipline. I currently struggle to do a length. I went swimming in the pool today for the first time in many years. I managed several lengths. None consecutively.</p>
<p><b>Bike</b><br />
I can manage a few miles on a bike. I need to work on high cadence - my school of thought until recently was that you should go in the highest gear you could - this really isn't good strategy for endurance!</p>
<p><b>Run</b><br />
I've just finished Week 5 of the <a href="http://www.runnersworld.co.uk/news/article.asp?UAN=30">Runner's World Beginners Plan</a>. So I'm managing to do 24 minutes running in 30. My last run was a worry, as I managed to do 5km exactly in 30 mins. </p>
<p>I've entered the <a href="http://www.royalparkshalf.com/">Royal Parks Half Marathon</a> on October 12. I'd love to do it in under 2 hours. However, that is predicted by a 26 min 5K, so there's some work to do.</p>
