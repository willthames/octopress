<h3>What went well</h3>
<p>Good long bike and long run, met all of my planned targets after Tuesday. Had a good but hard long ride in the Surrey Hills yesterday, legs didn't hurt as badly as last time but still need to build up to a heavy hilly ride. </p>
<h3>What didn't go well</h3>
<p>Monday was an unplanned rest day due to excess work. Tuesday evening was also written off. Missed one swim, one run, one bike and one core session as a result. Forgot to take my shoes in on Thursday, although just moved the run to Friday instead. </p>
<h3>Thoughts for next week's plan</h3>
<p>I should prioritise the bike more - I managed three runs this week but only two bikes - I can already run a half marathon, so probably need more practice cycling. Should have a great long ride next weekend - plan is for a longer, but less steep, ride. </p>
