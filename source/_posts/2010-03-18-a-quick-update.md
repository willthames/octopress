Missed quite a few weekly updates - it's now less than 19 weeks to go! Scary! I should probably be in the build phase now, but I need to remind myself what that looks like. 

Although my training log should shortly show what I've been up to (I've been a bit remiss there too), it's worth briefly laying it out. I spent last week skiing in Les Arcs, which probably wasn't ideal triathlon training but did make for a lovely holiday. Since my return I've been active nearly every day; before I left I had a pretty active week too until the Thursday at least. 

Need to get properly into the swing of things, although the calendar isn't looking great for the long rides - there'll be a few missed ones in the next few months, due to holidays (although hoping to get a bike or two done in Lanzarote) and weddings (three in six weekends from May to June).
