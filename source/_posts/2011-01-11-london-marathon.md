When work's new charity of the year, the <a href="http://www.prostate-cancer.org.uk">Prostate Cancer Charity</a> was announced, I emailed our charity coordinator to see if they had any places. Unfortunately, they didn't. 

Today I got an email asking if I still wanted a place! Of course I do! The London Marathon is the one event I've wanted to do since starting running! 

Not long to go though - just 14 weeks to build back up to marathon distance. I should be pretty conditioned to running after last month's efforts, but I know I need to build up nice and gently - destroying myself with injury would not be good. 

At least I know what the next three months' training looks like - a marathon training plan with some cross-training of cycling and swimming. FIRST should do the job, once I can actually do the long runs!
