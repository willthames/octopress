It was a casual question on my Wednesday night social trail run with 
Bunyaville Trail Runners that prompted my entry to the Nerang 50 - 
"Are you doing Nerang at the weekend?". I didn't even know it was on
but that question triggered a rapid succession of thoughts such
that by the time I got home I just needed to check a couple of things
before entering.

Once I'd checked the date and time, and that it wasn't full, I checked
with Peta whether it was ok - she was sceptical that it was a sensible
idea six weeks out from North Face, questioned whether I would break
myself - but I managed to persuade her, and thus myself, that it wasn't
a completely ludicrous idea.

And so at 3:50am on Sunday morning after less sleep than I'd have liked
I was getting out of bed and putting on my race gear, eating breakfast
and having a coffee, before a quick drive across to Albany Creek to pick
up Paul, a fellow runner, before a dash down the Pacific Motorway to the
velodrome at Nerang where the race starts.

After the usual pre-race preparation (race number, lube, sunscreen etc.),
I was ready for race start in good
time and after a few words about navigation from the race starter, we
were off. For about 200m before hitting a bottleneck (the stile into
the State Forest) and then came to a halt! Still, once through that
it was on and upwards. Even at 6am it didn't take long to start 
sweating!

I was very very conscious that it was going to be a tough day (my 
initial estimate was around 6 hours) and my mantra of the first of the
two 25km laps was "nice and casual". While on a course like that it's
almost impossible to avoid being out of breath, it's best to minimise
that as much as possible. As such, for most of the first lap, if I was
running, I was running at a pace that, at that temperature, I felt able
to run all day. 

The first lap was fairly uneventful - I was about 20m behind Paul for
most of it, and it was good to travel at a very sustainable pace. By
the end of the lap, I was looking forward to a 5 minute breather at 
the checkpoint as I refilled all my bottles. It was 9am at this point, and
warmed up. The idea of a second lap in those conditions when the first
really hadn't been that easy (I distinctly remember thinking about not
looking forward to the second time around) was tough, but I'd made far
too many compromises in the first lap that not doing the second lap
would have made the whole day an absolute waste of time.

And so I continued onto the second lap. I knew I wasn't running as much
but I didn't really feel that uncomfortable - I managed to continue at
a pace that I could sustain in those temperatures. Sometimes cloud cover
really helped, sometimes there was a breeze, and those times were great
for the short period of time they lasted! But when I was running, I was
doing well, and overtaking other runners.

At about 5km into the run, I was just catching back up with Paul, who
hadn't spent as long at the checkpoint, when I heard him asking someone
if they were ok. They said they were, so he carried on. I got to the 
same person and he was just sitting there. I asked if he had everything
he needed, and at this point he said he was out of water. He said he was
ok and would carry onto the checkpoint, but I knew that wasn't going
to happen without water. As I'd done a complete refill (so I probably
had 2.5 litres) I knew I could spare quite a bit so gave him what I thought
would get him through. I don't really know what happened to him after
that - I would be surprised if he finished.

Anyway, with my load lighter I was able to push on through, and
a bit later passed Paul who was suffering from cramping, and
some of the other runners too. By
the time I got to the 37km checkpoint I was happy to be able to refill
my camelbak (my front bottles containing energy drink were about half
full still, so I left them as they were). I also had a couple of cups of
water and a couple of flat coke too. 

My recollection of the second half of the first lap was that it was
the easier of the two halves, and that there were no real tough hills
after the 'gutbuster' shortly after the midway checkpoint. How I managed
to forget so many hills within 25kms is beyond me - suffice to say there
was a lot of walking in that final quarter. It was also so hot that 
even at the top of hills I was no longer able to run immediately. But
once I did get my breath back I was able to run - certainly it was never
really my legs that were holding me back. 

I used my energy drinks as a kind of reward strategy - sipping on it every
so often to keep my spirits up. And once they were almost empty, I siphoned
some of my remaining water into them so that I could at least have some 
vaguely flavoured water! I was a bit surprised at how little water I 
finished with, considering.

The second half took about 3:25, probably just under half an hour slower
than the first half. Given the very different conditions, I'm happy with
that. I finished in 6:27 which, when comparing to races such as 
Glasshouse 50 in similar temperatures but 
less elevation, seems about right for me. 

I do think it was an excellent training run, and gave me the opportunity
to test my race and nutrition strategies and suffer a little with heat
and elevation. I think it proves that I'm about six weeks ahead in my
training compared to this time last year (as I reckon I could have done
last year's TNF 50 yesterday - TNF 50 is harder but cooler) 
so just need to keep training well to be able to survive the 100. 

I'll have to take this week as it comes - I wasn't too sore or stiff this
morning but it could be worse tomorrow! And of course Saturday is Pinnacles
so we'll see how Nerang affects that.
