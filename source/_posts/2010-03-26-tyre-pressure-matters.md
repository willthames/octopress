So, a sluggish start to tonight's rollers session. I tested that the rollers weren't obstructed, that the wheels were turning fine. What I didn't check was tyre pressure. 

After 30 mins of an awful session, I got the pump out. Plugging it in I found my tyres were at 40 PSI! Oops! 

Pumped them back up to 90, and what a difference - from struggling to exceed 24kph for longer than a minute at a time, to exceeding 30kph for the rest of the session. 

Yet another chink in the armour stopping me shelling out on a powermeter - I'd at least have spotted that the effort required was much bigger than it should have been.
