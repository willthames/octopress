Successfully completed another week of running, this time without a visit to the treadmill, thankfully. Was thinking of doing a 5km run today but having suffered through a 12km at very slow pace, very glad I didn't!

Seem to be doing quite well at alternating easy and hard days, which is good as it allows recovery.

Tried using a foam roller for the first time today to try and allow my calves some release, will see how my legs appreciate that tomorrow.
