> The only way to discover the limits of the possible is to go beyond them into the impossible &mdash; Arthur C. Clarke

Day one started well &mdash; we'd worked out the tram system the day before and so got to the
start line in plenty of time. We spent some of that time taking photographs and saying our
farewells, and I was definitely feeling relaxed and ready to go. The first 5km were very
flat and a good time to warm up the legs and get into a nice easy rhythm, ready for the
forthcoming ascents.

Ascending St Nizier du Moucherotte seemed relatively straightforward. All of the time I
kept thinking of the training runs I'd done that were much harder (even if not of the
same length). So my ascents of Kokoda track in Mt Coot-tha, or Chainsaw on Camp Mountain,
any of the 30% grade breaks I'd done all gave me plenty of mental comparison with things
that I'd achieved. One of my comparison points is of ascents of Camp Mountain (so a 1000m
climb is like doing 5 Camp Mountain ascents) and that worked well for the first 40km.
The St Nizier du Moucherotte checkpoint was at the top of a ski jump, and I have great
admiration for anyone who does the jump and then climbs the stairs back to the top with skis
&mdash; those stairs were very steep and seemed to go on for a very long time!

From St Nizier to the top of Moucherotte itself was another 600m of ascent in quite spectacular
scenery. Watching the trails of people on the ascent winding their way to the top was
quite awe inspiring, and it was good to reach the top. The first couple of kms of descent
weren't much fun (lots of loose rock) but I enjoyed the rest of the run down to Lans-en-Vercors
for my first checkpoint with support crew. Peta and Paul did a great job of sorting me out
by topping up bottles and making sure I was ok.

From Lans-en-Vercors was the walk up to Pic St. Michel, and then the descent into
St. Paul de Varces. I don't really remember too much about this bit other than
the stop at St Paul de Varces, where there was a fountain with fresh cold spring
water, so a great place to drench my hat, fill my bottles and have a refreshing cool
drink. I'm not really sure how I forgot a 1500m descent but clearly things weren't
too painful at that point. There was a lot of relying on poles to manage the descent,
whether using them to hop over obstacles or push myself around corners, but
Looking at the timings, the descent wasn't very runnable
(11:00/km for 200m descent is pretty slow!) so I obviously had to take some care.

There was a small hill (Montagne d'Uriol) between St Paul de Varces and Vif
but it wasn't significant in itself and then there was the downhill to
Vif, which was actually quite pleasant (one of the few enjoyable downhill sections).
On arriving at Vif it was great to see Peta and Paul, and judging from the photos
I looked a right state in the heat, but between us all we managed to sort out my feet
and hydration. Were I doing the UT4M Vercors 40, I could have stopped here, and perhaps
been very happy.

From Vif the trail went up 100m to the level of the train line above the town and then
back down to cross the Drac, where Peta and Paul passed me in the car and shouted
encouragement. Then it was over Col de la Chai, via the village of
Saint-Georges-de-Commiers. That village had a lovely water trough with a push button
tap &mdash; so fresh cool water on demand. One of the defining monents of the climb to
Col de la Chai was the stop at another water trough, where everyone stopped to wet
their hats and cool their heads and top up their supplies. I've never seen a race
where cool water was such a premium and so useful at the same time (the temperature
was around 29&deg;C so this isn't too surprising)! From Col de la
Chai it was a relatively straightforward and pleasant descent to Laffrey.

From Laffrey we went over Grande Cuche and down to La Morte.
The descent to La Morte was that it was nominally a 166m descent, but just before we
got to La Morte there was a 100m climb. This was unexpected and annoying but the final
descent into the village was enjoyable. We had mandatory kit check at La Morte, which
only got annoying when they started checking for different things to what the sign
said at the station.  Again Peta and Paul were heroes, and
provided me with hot stew, it was nice to have some actual food (Tailwind works really
well but can get a bit samey). They provided me with all the things I needed for
the planned next five hours. I switched from cap to headlamp, and also put on the
arm warmers. I was an hour behind schedule at this point but that
was fine (and given 100m of extra ascent and descent adds another 9 minutes to my
schedule, it's easy to see how that kind of thing adds up).

From La Morte was perhaps one of the most difficult climbs of the day, up Pas de
la Vache, nearly 900m of ascent. By this time it was dark and I could sometimes
see the lights far above me. It looked pretty difficult, to say the least, the
lights were so high! As
always, one foot in front of the other, again and again, for 4km. In addition
to the usual reflective tape there were occasionally burning logs or flaming
torches (can't imagine that getting signed off in Australia!). In the end the
climb took 1h45, which wasn't too much slower than predicted. At the top
it was a lot cooler, and the arm warmers and even waterproof jacket came in
useful at various points from here on in.

Unfortunately my watch ran out of battery shortly after Pas de la Vache,
so I don't really have a clear idea where the time went compared to schedule,
but I arrived at Lac du Poursollet at 00:30 and I recall not really enjoying
the descent too much. One of the people at the aid station saw the Australian
flag on my race number and said "Oh, an actual Australian, they'll be so
excited to have you, not a fake Australian like me" &mdash; so I explained that I
was no more Australian than him! He helped me with my bottles and told me
where I was in relation to cutoffs (7 hours buffer) and told me that the
descent to Riouperoux was very hard and that I should take care and take it
slowly.

From Lac du Poursollet we went over Pas de l'Enviou, which was another
climb that felt a lot bigger than it was (but probably wasn't any bigger).
The route from there to Chalets de la Barri√®re was a bit more runnable
but there still seemed to be a lot of ascents in what was supposed to be
a 2km downhill section and it definitely felt a lot longer than 2km.
After filling my bottles I wished I'd brought along some gloves (which
weren't mandatory)

My final section for the day was down to Riouperoux &mdash; 5km of descent
down rocky, slippery, screey switchbacks. I didn't feel able to run
almost any of this section, and on one of the times I did try running
my left foot slipped off the path and I somehow tumbled onto my front,
bashing my left thumb against my walking pole, hitting my face on the
ground. My right knee felt a little niggly as a result but it could have
been a lot worse. The biggest knock was probably to my confidence which
was already pretty bad on the descents. For a lot of the descent I
could see the lights of Riouperoux in the far distance below and it
just felt like it took a really long time &mdash; even when we got to the road
at the bottom of the hill, it must have been another km to the checkpoint!

I was so glad to reach the checkpoint. By now my phone had run out of
battery too, I had a portable charger in my drop bag (but no phone cable).
I had a look around all the laptops in the checkpoint and saw one that
had a sign "Laptop not for public use" but also a cable coming out of it
that fit my phone. So I used the cable to charge my phone next to the
laptop (so that whoever's laptop it was knew I wasn't stealing the cable)
and charged it enough to send some texts to Peta to let her know to
come to Riouperoux the next morning as I wasn't sure at this stage that
I wanted to continue but wanted to talk to her first before any final
decision. I then bunked down on the floor of the rest room to grab
three hours sleep, having put on my fleece and long trousers to keep
warm, and even then wrapping myself in the blanket.
