<p>My second go at swimming this week. Some progress was made - I swam for a bit with my face in the water, breathing out underwater, and turning my head to breathe in. Occasionally I got the timing of this wrong and inhaled water. This had the side effect of making me keep my head above water, which is bad form! I also tried to remember to push my arms into the water at an angle, rather than flop them in at the end of a windmill cycle. I may have forgotten to kick in all of this. Too many things to remember at once.</p>
<p>Ah well, I managed three consecutive lengths, twice, and several double lengths, and some singles. I also tried to sink to the bottom of the pool, but am too buoyant. I suspect breathing out might help, but then I want to breathe in, and then I might drown!</p>
