Following <a href="http://www.trainingbible.com/joesblog/2009/06/ironman-race-plan.html">Joe Friel's advice</a>, here is my race plan: 

<h2>Ironman Switzerland 2010</h2>
"Finish healthily tired"

<h3>Goal</h3>
13 hrs (01:30/07:30/04:00) 

<h4>Keys for success</h4><ul><li>Ride consistently</li>
<li>Eat well on the bike
<li>Eat something on the run
<li>Drink consistently
<li>Run steadily, with walk breaks for water</ul>

<h3>Race week</h3><ul><li>In bed by 11pm
<li>No alcohol
<li>No coffee
<li>Day off Thursday to do local preparation (pick up bike box, pack, rest)
<li>Race preparation day Friday, Family day Saturday
<li>Charge computer and watch</ul>

<h3>Race day</h3>
04:15 wake up, dress, prepare race bottles
04:30 breakfast - one coffee, some cereal, toast
05:00 coach leaves hotel
06:00 body marking?
06:05 Sunscreen on
06:20 Bike ready: low gear, bottles, computer attached, tyres pumped, towel down, socks and armwarmers prerolled
06:25 Run ready: run shoes in place, watch, food in place
06:35 Wetsuit on, body glide applied, goggles under hat
06:45 flush wetsuit and short swim if possible 
07:00 We're off!

<h4>Swim</h4>
Aim: 01:30
Start at the back left
Keep out of everyone's way, and then just swim smooth and slow until I'm finished
Sight well, swim straight

<h4>T1</h4>
Turn computer on
Finish removing wetsuit, goggles, cap
Helmet on
Dry feet
Socks on
Shoes on
Race belt on
Food in pocket
Take bike to mount line
GO!

<h4>Bike</h4>
Aim: 07:30
"Make most of flat!"

0-30km flat
30-35km 100m ascent
35-45km flattish
45-52km down
52-57km big up
57-65km down then smaller up
65-70km big descent
70-83km flat
83-85km Heartbreak up and down
85-120km flat
120-125km 100m ascent
125-135km flattish
135-142km down
142-147km big up
147-15km down then smaller up
155-160km big descent
160-173km flat
173-175km Heartbreak up and down
175-180km flat


Computer will be set to beep every 10km - which will be every 24mins, on average
After first 10km and then at 100km, eat bar, wash down with water. 
Drink a small amount of energy drink as I feel
Drink from gel flask and wash down with water every 10km that I'm not eating a bar
Refill water at 60km if need be as no more water for another 60km!
Energy drink will be refreshed through packets of SIS Go that can be emptied into bottle. 

Aim to make the most of the flat sections by travelling at around 30kph, and take the climbs nice and easy.

<h4>T2</h4>
Stop bike computer
Rack bike
Helmet off
Turn watch on
Gloves off
Bike shoes off
Run shoes on
Move race belt round
Swap to run food
GO!
Start watch

<h4>Run</h4>
Aim 04:00
"Finish strong"

Four laps of 10.55km. 
First lap should feel relatively easy, last lap very hard, but aim is to finish strong. 

Target pace of 05:39/km, this allows 6 seconds/km break - so after 5km I can stop for 30seconds or walk for 1 min. This means that I can take on water regularly (both drink and for cooling if very hot)

One shot blok before a water stop at around every 5km, with two taken every ten.
