Writing this has helped to ensure that everything is in the right place for tomorrow. One could probably argue 
I carry too much stuff, but I like to be safe and prepared, and relatively self-sufficient.

Tomorrow will be my first experience with dropbags, so I've tried to ensure stuff will be in the right place.

Even writing this I realised that my understanding of where the checkpoints wasn't quite right (I thought that
4 and 7 were one-third and two-thirds around the course, rather than one-quarter and three-quarters), so I've 
just added a second drop bag for checkpoint 8, that I'll now have to go and pack.
