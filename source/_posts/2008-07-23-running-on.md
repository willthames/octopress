I decided to see whether my knee was just stiffening up or anything more serious. This test was by going for my current training run (3 sets of 12 mins running, 1 min walking).

The good news - I got around, and hardly noticed my knee. Except during the walking bits! I certainly felt it when walking home from my run, but after coming home, doing my stretches, taking a warm shower, it doesn't feel any worse than it did before.

Not quite sure whether to carry on like this, and do some strength training to protect the knee, or to go see a sports physio, or even a gait analyst. My shoes do have a funny wear pattern (just one side of the heel).
