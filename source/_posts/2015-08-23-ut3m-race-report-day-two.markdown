I did feel a bit better after my sleep, and my legs still seemed to function,
with the knee niggle from my fall seeming better for the rest. I knew I could
continue but not whether I actually wanted to.

When Peta and Paul arrived they were sympathetic and supportive. In the end
Peta decided we should toss a coin to continue. Heads to continue, tails to
pull out. The point of the coin toss is to help decide whether you actually
care about the result, but I actually felt almost indifferent. In the end
Heads won the day, so I continued. It was that close - I do think I would
have pulled out if it had been Tails! We also arranged that I'd next see
Paul at Refuge de La Pra in a few hours.

I knew that the first stages of the day were basically an accumulation of
1600m of climbing from Riouperoux to Croix de Chamrousse. The first step
was the 1000m to Arselle, which was just a long long slog. Every so often
the route was marked with signs from the Vertical Kilometre race, marking
the ascent in 100m intervals. It seemed to take a while for each extra 100m.
I was having to pause quite regularly to regain my breath but I was not
unhappy with my pace. After the long climb, there was a flat section where
I even managed to do some running for a bit, some of the only running
all day.

I had a quick stop to refill bottles etc. at Arselle before the climb up
Croix de Chamrousse. The climb was a lot gentler than the Arselle climb,
an average gradient of 10% rather than 25%! This was far more to my taste
and I was able to maintain a steadier pace.


Getting to Croix de Chamrousse

And Refuge de la Pra

Stupid Big Arsehole

At the top of Grand Colon, I knew that I had had enough. I would have quite
happily stopped, but I had to get down to Freydières either way! When I checked 
what was next
after Freydières, I knew that I couldn't face yet another 1000m of descent. I let Peta
know to expect this, and pack for me finishing. Before my final descent a few of the
people I'd met during the day accompanied me for a bit, but in the end outpaced me as
I was descending so dismally. During that final descent I discovered that I'd managed
less than 3km/h for the entire day, which would definitely be insufficient to finish,
and again just helped me accept that I was making the right decision to abandon.

Bon Courage was something I heard so much on the race - it seemed to be most people's best
wish of choice. I like the phrase a lot in that it's so much more appealing than 'good luck'
as it focuses on internal strength rather than external factors over which you have no
control. Courage to me is also the strength to know when to stop and I hope I took a
courageous choice to stop on my own terms rather than destroy myself only to still miss
the cut offs.

Thank you so much to my amazing support crew - they stuck by me even when I was questioning
my commitment to continue, and also when I decided it was time to abandon. I changed plans
on them a number of times (including when I told them I'd like flat coke and then after having
some flat coke remembered that caffeine currently seems to give me chest problems). It is
a tough job being support crew - basically being out in the sticks just waiting around until
I finally deign to arrive, a mad rush of servicing my needs for 5-20 minutes and then back
to the waiting around stuff. I'm glad to see Peta and Paul made the best of it with lakeside
pizzas and beer/wine.

The race organisation was good for a race of this scale, but it was a very French race
and sometimes my lack of fluency in French was a problem (I can usually ask for things but
don't understand very much that is said to me - I can read French far better
than I can hear it).

The route markings were absolutely excellent in
general, I only went slightly wrong twice the entire time, and quickly realised
my mistake because I could always expect to see a marker within the next few footsteps)

My running plans are now fairly low-key. I have zero plans to attempt such a thing again,
at least not with the ability to train for it properly, which is very hard to do where we live
(bayside Queensland, with the nearest 50m hill 10km away, the nearest 300m hill 30km away and
the nearest 1000m hill 100km away). For now I plan on doing some parkruns, and hanging out
with my running friends for fun running. I may do some of the local trail run series.

Our house renovations mean that it's a good time to reduce my running schedule and focus on
that priority - I still aim to achieve 30-40km/week but leave the weekends free other than
parkrun or one local trail race.

I will be making a UT3M t-shirt. I feel I've earned a t-shirt (but definitely not a UT4M
finishers top, which I would not allow myself to wear), and something that helps me
remember what I can do, and what I currently can't do, will be nice to have.
