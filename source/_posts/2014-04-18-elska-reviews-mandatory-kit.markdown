Tomorrow I'm going for a run with as much of the 
[North Face 100 Mandatory Kit](http://www.thenorthface100.com.au/RaceInfo/#MandatoryGear) 
as I possess (I'm missing a food bar and the waterproof trousers, and some
of the stuff provided by the event - maps, firelighters etc). This should give 
me an insight as to whether I need to tweak my backpack or packing and just give 
some good training!

I thought I'd take a photo of everything I needed, so laid it all out on the
bed. And then Elska, our ragdoll cat, decided to help take stock
