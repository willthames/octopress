With just 12 days to go until the race, things are definitely getting
exciting. My race pack arrived today, with map and race number!

Had a great run up Camp Mountain today with the Bunyaville Trail Runners,
I didn't manage to run all the way to the top, but given I had my full race
pack on in training for the race I didn't mind too much. And I made up for 
it on the downhills, they felt great. 

Training wise, I feel in a good place - my legs feel in great shape.

Looking at the conditions in the mountains, if it's like today, the starting
temperature will be not much above zero and max temperature below 20C.
I might need to take some warmer clothes than I was planning - but those 
conditions would be ideal for me!
