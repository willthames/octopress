Goals for last week:<ul><li>Swim Twice.</li><li>Do two lots of 30 mins constant running.</li><li>Do 9-10km long run at the weekend.</li><li>Go to see some of the London Triathlon.</li></ul>
Mon: Swim 30 mins
Tue: Ran 30 mins - to Putney Bridge, across, and then back
Thu: Ran 30 mins - to Barnes Bridge, across, and then back
Fri: Swam 30 mins, then 30 mins gym
Sat: went to see some of the London Triathlon
Sun: Ran 50 mins in one go (10km including warm up) - it really rained on this run, which may have cooled me down and actually improved my performance!

So, a pretty successful week!

Goals for this week:<ul><li>Swim Twice.</li><li>Do two lots of 30 mins constant running.</li><li>Do 10-11km long run at the weekend.</li><li>Book a swimming coach.</li></ul>
I might also do some thinking about whether two 30 mins constant running is the best use of two training sessions - maybe an interval session could replace one of them.
