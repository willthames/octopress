On 19th July, at 7am, I will be joining a team of three other runners to 
do the [Kokoda Challenge](http://kokodachallenge.com/kokoda-challenge-event-details),
a 96km trail race through the Gold Coast hinterland. The hinterland is not
flat - there is around 5000m of elevation gain over the course, and the 
elevation profile has some very mean looking sections - this
race promises to be no easier than the North Face, and the team has to remain
within 150m for the whole 96km. 

The money raised is for the Kokoda Youth Foundation, who run the 
[Kokoda Challenge Youth Program](http://kokodachallenge.com/youth-program-details), 
a program that aims to help Australian teens get out and active and working
together to complete some great accomplishments - to me it is akin to 
supporting young people who couldn't necessarily afford it to do the 
Australian equivalent of a Duke of Edinburgh award.

Please consider sponsoring me - if you're in Australia, it's nearly tax time,
and you can beam with pride when the accountant asks you what donations you've
made. If you're in the UK, you'll be amazed when you donate some Australian
dollars just how few UK pounds it actually costs - $25 is less than Â£15 at
the moment!

You can sponsor us on our [team donation page](https://kokodachallenge.com/donate-online/7315). 
Apologies that I don't yet appear in the team photo on the
[team page](https://kokodachallenge.com/team-profile/the-other-btrs-7315) - 
I was a last minute substitution as one of the other team members is sadly 
too injured to run.
