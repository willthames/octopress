Managed two sets of six lengths each swimming in my own way, plus a few lengths up and down while breathing out underwater, trying to concentrate on technique. It's the maintaining reasonable style while managing breathing at the same time that I struggle with.

Technique still needs work, endurance is getting there, more practice and then some coaching should do it.
