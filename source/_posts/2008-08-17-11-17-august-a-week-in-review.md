Goals for last week:<ul><li>Swim Twice.</li><li>Do two lots of 30 mins constant running.</li><li>Do 10-11km long run at the weekend.</li><li>Book a swimming coach.</li></ul>

Mon: Swam 30 mins
Tue: Ran 30 mins - to Putney Bridge, across, and then back
Wed: Swam 30 mins
Thu: Ran 30 mins - to Putney Bridge, across, and then back
Sat: First consultation session with <a href="http://www.swimfortri.com">SwimForTri</a> - one hour in endless pool deconstructing my technique
Sun: Ran 11.5km in one hour in one go (plus 1km warm up beforehand) - very pleased with this result, with 8 weeks to go before my half-marathon, looks like sub 2hr is not a completely insane goal.

So, another pretty successful week!

I'm flying to Australia on Friday night, so not sure how the weekend's long run will happen, but I'll be on holiday, so should have plenty of time for running and swimming

Goals for this week:<ul><li>Swim Twice.</li><li>Do two lots of 30 mins constant running.</li><li>Long run in Australia on Sunday or Monday</li><li>Dedicate some time to thinking about my schedule to include classes (spinning, pilates), and types of training (tempo, interval, easy, etc.) and how to optimise to achieve my goals</li><li>Pack swim and run kit</li></ul>
